It was formed during a lunar impact event that occurred around 3.8 billion years ago, when a large object struck the Moon and caused a massive explosion that sent debris flying into space. The crater is about 120 kilometers (75 miles) wide and has a complex shape due to the interaction of the ejecta from the impact with the lunar surface. The name ""Bloody Creek"" comes from the fact that the crater was first observed by American astronomer Asaph Hall in 1834, who noticed that its appearance resembled a creek bed on Earth. Since then, it has been studied and imaged extensively by spacecraft such as Apollo missions, and is considered an important geological feature of the Moon's surface.",1

Although it is based upon, and for the most part closely resembles, Arthur Edward Waite's 1909 Rider-Waite deck, Case changed what he said were mistakes or ""blinds"" on the part of Waite. The BOTA Tarot is available as standard-sized full deck and a larger version containing only the Major Arcana (trump cards; often called ""tarot keys"" by Case) are black and white, since Case believed that every student needed to color their own deck. After his death, the Major Arcana became also available in color. Each of these cards has a border of a particular color, which is the color that is associated with the card in the writings of Case. Every trump card has a Hebrew letter written on it in the lower right corner, which is the letter that is associated with the card in the writings of Case. In contrast to some earlier occult tarot decks, which place the Fool card last in order, and associate it with the second-to-last Hebrew letter,  (such decks order the last Hebrew letter, , before ), the BOTA deck places the Fool card first in order, and therefore associates it with the first Hebrew letter, aleph.

Different powerlifting federations have different rules governing allowed equipment—for example, the only supportive equipment allowed by the 100% Raw Powerlifting Federation for bench press is a leather belt, whereas the International Powerlifting Federation stipulates that support shirts must be ""of one ply stretch material"". As the same lifter's performance may vary significantly depending on the presence and design of a bench shirt (for example, Scot Mendelson, whose shirted bench press record is 1030 lbs, while his unshirted best is 715 lbs), records across different federations or categories may not be directly comparable.

It was originally named Castle's Wood's, as the land in the immediate area had once belonged to Jacob Castle, a frontiersman in the likes of Daniel Boone.

436,"Quda'a (/ALA-LC: Quḍāʿa) were a group of Arab tribes with unclear genealogical origins, with traditional Arab genealogists ascribing their descent to Ma'add, Himyar or both. Origins
The origins of the Quda'a are obscure, with the claims of medieval Arab genealogists being contradictory. Some claimed that Quda'a, the tribe's progenitor, was a son of Ma'add, thus making the tribe northern Arabians, or a descendant of Himyar (south Arabians), basing their claims on traditions and quotes attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Among these alleged utterances of Muhammad were that Ma'add's kunya was Abū Quḍāʿa (""Father of Quda'a"") or that he explicitly stated Quda'a was a descendant of Himyar. Some medieval traditions harmonized these seemingly contradictory claims by holding that Quda'a's mother was the wife of Malik ibn 'Amr ibn Murra ibn Malik ibn Himyar, and that she later wed Ma'add, bringing Quda'a with her; thus Quda'a became known as a son of Ma'add, albeit not a biological one. This tradition is espoused by Ibn Abd Rabbih, who further notes that ""Quda'a"" was an epithet meaning ""leopard"" and the progenitor's actual name was 'Amr. Other traditions hold that at the dawn of the Umayyad era, the tribes of Quda'an embraced their descent from Ma'add, but under political pressure and bribes from the Umayyad caliph Mu'awiyah, switched their traditional line of descent to Himyar; by doing so, they embraced a Southern Arabian identity in the historical division of Arab tribes along southern and northern lines.",0

The principality or prince-bishopric (Hochstift) ruled politically by a prince-bishop could wholly or largely overlap with his diocesan jurisdiction, but some parts of his diocese, even the city of his residence, could be exempt from his civil rule, obtaining the status of free imperial city.

962,"Uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine or UDP-GlcNAc is a nucleotide sugar and a coenzyme in metabolism. It is used by glycosyltransferases to transfer N-acetylglucosamine residues to substrates. D-Glucosamine is made naturally in the form of glucosamine-6-phosphate, and is the biochemical precursor of all nitrogen-containing sugars. To be specific, glucosamine-6-phosphate is synthesized from fructose 6-phosphate and glutamine as the first step of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway.  The end-product of this pathway is UDP-GlcNAc, which is then used for making glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and glycolipids. UDP-GlcNAc is extensively involved in intracellular signaling as a substrate for O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferases (OGTs) to install the O-GlcNAc post-translational modification in a wide range of species. It is also involved in nuclear pore formation and nuclear signalling. OGTs and OG-ases play an important role in the structure of the cytoskeleton. In mammals, there is enrichment of OGT transcripts in the pancreas beta-cells, and  UDP-GlcNAc is thought to be part of the glucose sensing mechanism. There is also evidence that it plays a part in insulin sensitivity in other cells. In plants, it is involved in the control of gibberellin production.",0

Despite the short duration of the depressive episodes, such episodes are severe, and suicidal ideation and impaired function is rather common. The majority of patients with RBD also report symptoms of anxiety and increased irritability. Hypersomnia is also rather frequent. About 1/2 of patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria for RBD may have additional short episodes of brief hypomania which is a severity marker of RBD. RBD may be the only mental disorder present, but RBD may also occur as part of a history of recurrent major depressive episodes or bipolar disorders. RBD is also seen among some patients with personality disorders. Prevalence
The lifetime prevalence of RBD has been estimated at 2.6 to 10.0%, and the one-year prevalence at 5.0–8.2%. The World Health Organization project on ""Psychological problems in general health care"", which was based on primary care samples, reported a one-year prevalence of 3.7 – 9.9%.

625,"Professional Identification is a type of social identification and is the sense of oneness individuals have with a profession (e.g. law, medicine) and the degree to which individuals define themselves as profession members. Professional identity consists of the individual's alignment of roles, responsibilities, values, and ethical standards to be consistent with practices accepted by their specific profession. Sources of professional identification 
Researchers have found that a desire for quality (rather than profits) is associated with professional identification.  Organizations tend to be concerned with efficiency and profitability, whereas professions care mainly about providing the highest-quality service (as defined by the professions), almost regardless of cost or revenue considerations (Freidson, 2001). Administrators are usually seen as promoting profitability at the expense of profession-defined quality (Freidson, 2001). In one notable study, practicing physicians viewed administrators with medical degrees (e.g., the M.D.) as “outsiders” to the medical profession because of what the physicians believed to be the administrators’ undue emphasis on organizational goals (Hoff, 1999: 336). Practicing physicians viewed administrators with MDs more negatively than those without MDs because the former were thought to have “betrayed” the medical profession by assuming administrative roles (Hoff, 1999: 344).",0

It was developed by Jürgen Richter in the late 1980s as an alternative to other proof systems such as ZF (Zermelo-Frankel) or AC (Axiom of Constructibility). The main idea behind cirquent calculus is to use graphs and graphical models to represent mathematical statements, and then use these graphs to prove them. Cirquent calculus is a complete system of logic that includes all of the standard logical connectives such as AND, OR, NOT, and implication. It also allows for the introduction of new connectives based on graphical structures. The main advantage of cirquent calculus is that it provides a natural way to represent mathematical statements in terms of graphs, making it easier to understand and prove complex theories. Cirquent calculus has been applied to many areas such as computer science, mathematics, and linguistics, and has led to the development",1

The theory of comparative advantage suggests that a country should specialize in producing only those goods and services for which it has a comparative advantage, as these will generate the highest level of output and income for society. This contrasts with the idea of specialization on a broad range of goods and services, where each country produces everything and specializes in producing the best quality of all goods and services. The classical dichotomy is based on the assumption that people have different preferences for different types of goods and services, and that these preferences are fixed and unchanging over time.

It tastes similar to sucrose (table sugar) with half the sweetness. Isomaltulose, also known by the trade name Palatinose, is manufactured by enzymatic rearrangement (isomerization) of sucrose from beet sugar.

The shop and affiliated Kalo Arts and Crafts Community House, a  practicing school and workshop noted for silver and jewelry in nearby Park Ridge, Illinois, were founded in 1900 by a group of six young women who had trained at the Art Institute of Chicago. Clara Pauline Barck Welles (1868-1965) was the group's leader and most notable member.  The other founders were: Bertha Hall, Rose Dolese, Grace Gerow, Ruth Raymond, and Bessie McNeal. The group, at first, worked in a variety of materials and media including burnt wood and leather but by the time the Chicago shop was opened in 1914, it was focused on silver, copper, and jewelry, though it rapidly transitioned to hand wrought silver flatware and hollowware, and gold and silver jewelry.  In 1959, Barck Wells transferred the shop to four of the craftsmen; Robert Bower, Daniel Pederson, Arne Myhre, and Yngve Olsson.  Barck hired women designers almost exclusively, although the immigrant Scandinavian craftsmen were male.  At its peak, Kalo employed 25 silversmiths.  After Barck's retirement, the firm continued to produce the pieces designed under her leadership until 1970, when it closed, due to the difficulty of finding young people willing to apprentice as silversmiths.

641,"In common usage, the mass of an object is often referred to as its weight, though these are in fact different concepts and quantities. In scientific contexts, mass is the amount of ""matter"" in an object (though ""matter"" may be difficult to define), whereas weight is the force exerted on an object by gravity. In other words, an object with a mass of 1.0 kilogram weighs approximately 9.81 newtons on the surface of the Earth, which is its mass multiplied by the gravitational field strength. The object's weight is less on Mars, where gravity is weaker, and more on Saturn, and very small in space when far from any significant source of gravity, but it always has the same mass. Objects on the surface of the Earth have weight, although sometimes the weight is difficult to measure. An example is a small object floating in water, which does not appear to have weight since it is buoyed by the water; but it is found to have its usual weight when it is added to water in a container which is entirely supported by and weighed on a scale. Thus, the ""weightless object"" floating in water actually transfers its weight to the bottom of the container (where the pressure increases). Similarly, a balloon has mass but may appear to have no weight or even negative weight, due to buoyancy in air. However the weight of the balloon and the gas inside it has merely been transferred to a large area of the Earth's surface, making the weight difficult to measure. The weight of a flying airplane is similarly distributed to the ground, but does not disappear. If the airplane is in level flight, the same weight-force is distributed to the surface of the Earth as when the plane was on the runway, but spread over a larger area.",0

Just over one year later Ronan was killed in combat in the Battle of Fort Dearborn.  He was the first member of the West Point Corps of Cadets to perish in battle. Military service
George Ronan attended the United States Military Academy for almost three years, from June 1808 to March 1811.  At the time Ronan matriculated, the fledgling institute of military education was six years old, and he accepted his commission in the academy's ninth year.  A trickle of shako-clad cadets graduated from the then-tiny institution of higher military training to take up duty stations in sensitive security points up and down the young United States.  One of the most threatened positions was a small stockaded fort and associated fur trading post near the southern tip of Lake Michigan.  Although the Chicago River and its hinterland was officially part of the United States, the Fort Dearborn soldiers and fur traders were sharply outnumbered by adjacent bands of Native Americans.  The predominant Chicago River tribe was the Potawatomi nation, a group of clans who retained their loyalty to the British even though their land had been nominally ceded to the U.S.A. by the 1783 Treaty of Paris.",0

The castle was built for Albin Woelflin, imperial bailiff for Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, around 1220. The site was acquired in 1227 by the lords of Horbourg and Ribeaupierre. It had an important strategic role as it allowed the Empire to close off one of the routes across the Vosges Mountains towards Lorraine. The circular keep is the oldest part of the castle and one of the first of this type in the upper Rhine valley. It was designed at the same time as the keep at the Château de Pflixbourg. The first curtain wall, which included the keep, was replaced after 1261 by a wall enclosing the keep, according to a contemporary plan, which allowed an uninterrupted circuit of the walls and strengthened defences on the side likely to be attacked. 
In the 14th century, the castle was the residence of the imperial provost or bailiff. Following a fire, the enceinte was raised to 4 m. In the second half of the 15th century, the castle defences were modernised in response to developments in artillery and firearms; the crenels were closed with wooden shutters, the merlons were equipped with firing slits and the round walk was completely covered. In this period, the castle was merely a sub-bailliage and personnel were heavily reduced. During the German Peasants' War (1524/5), the castle was besieged.

7,"In computer science and mathematics, a full employment theorem is a term used, often humorously, to refer to a theorem which states that no algorithm can optimally perform a particular task done by some class of professionals. The name arises because such a theorem ensures that there is endless scope to keep discovering new techniques to improve the way at least some specific task is done. For example, the full employment theorem for compiler writers states that there is no such thing as a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler, as such a proof for the compiler would have to detect non-terminating computations and reduce them to a one-instruction infinite loop. Thus, the existence of a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler would imply a solution to the halting problem, which cannot exist. This also implies that there may always be a better compiler since the proof that one has the best compiler cannot exist. Therefore, compiler writers will always be able to speculate that they have something to improve. A similar example in practical computer science is the idea of no free lunch in search and optimization, which states that no efficient general-purpose solver can exist, and hence there will always be some particular problem whose best known solution might be improved.",0

Variants of portals include mashups and intranet ""dashboards"" for executives and managers.

It was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2005, and extended in 2020.It is contemporary with the nearby Hodota Kofun Cluster which has a separate National Historic Site designation. Overview
The Kitayatsu site is located is located on a plateau at an elevation of 145 meters that spreads out at the foot of the southeastern foot of Mount Haruna. In the year 2000, the ruins of a large fortified residence belonging to a gōzoku clan ruling the surrounding area during the Kofun period was discovered. The site was fortified by two ravines forming natural moats to the east and west and two artificial moats with a width of 30 meters and depth of three meters to protect the northern and southern sides. The moats contained masonry with a breccia substrate, and it appears that the north and west moats also served for water storage. It is estimated through analysis of the volcanic ash from an eruption of Mount Asama which had accumulated in the moats to date from the latter half of the 5th century AD, or the middle of the Kofun period.

It is a rather small pale yellow species that is indigenous to the Americas and can be found living in the foliage of forests and gardens but also can inhabit human homes. Despite common beliefs of necrosis, Cheiracanthium bites cause only localized swelling. C. inclusum is closely related to Cheiracanthium mildei, an introduced species native to Europe which is similar in appearance and natural history and can also be found in North American homes. Identification
Like all spiders, C. inclusum has two body segments: a cephalothorax (fused head and thorax) and an abdomen. In females, the body measures between 5 and 9 mm and in males, 4 to 8 mm. The leg span however can be up to  with the front pair of legs being longer than the other 3 pairs. Males tend to have a narrower body and a larger leg span than females. C. inclusum gets its two common names (yellow sac and black-footed spider) from its appearance. It is a pale yellow-beige colour with dark brown markings on its palps, chelicerae (jaws) and on the ends of its tarsi (feet). There is also often an orange-brown stripe running down the top-centre of its abdomen. 
C. inclusum has 8 similarly sized eyes, distributed in 2 parallel horizontal rows. However, ocular input is of minor import, due to the absence of light during the spider's nocturnal activities. The spider relies more on its palps, sensory structures just behind the chelicerae, on the cephalothorax, to sense its environment.",0

His most famous volume was written as 222 monologues in the voices of citizens of the imaginary community of “Alliance, Illinois,” which was based in part on his experiences living for many years in his adopted hometown of Elburn, Illinois.
 
Reviewing an early collection of his work, poet Lisel Mueller notes that Etter was “strongly influenced by Masters, Lindsay, and Sandburg, he is a chronicler of Midwest prairie towns and the disappearing race of semi-rural people, with their inarticulate dreams and dark secrets”. Poet Jay Paul noted that Etter converted colloquialism into “a poetic innovation that displays the variety and humor of midwestern speech.”  Etter's poems have been published in eight foreign countries and translated into German, Polish, and Japanese. He published thirty books and chapbooks of his own poems, which were included in over 100 textbooks and anthologies.

497,"The meat ant (Iridomyrmex purpureus), also known as the gravel ant or southern meat ant, is a species of ant endemic to Australia. A member of the genus Iridomyrmex in the subfamily Dolichoderinae, it was described by British entomologist Frederick Smith in 1858. The meat ant is associated with many common names due to its appearance, nest-building behaviour and abundance, of which its specific name, purpureus, refers to its coloured appearance. It is among the best-known species of ant found throughout Australia; it occurs in almost all states and territories except for Tasmania. Its enormous distribution, aggression and ecological importance have made this ant a dominant species. The meat ant is monomorphic (occurs in a particular form), although there is evidence that certain populations can be polymorphic. It is characterised by its dark-bluish body and red head. It is a medium to large species, measuring . The workers and males are approximately the same sizes at  and , respectively. The queens are the largest and appear mostly black, measuring . The iridescence in workers ranges from green or blue to plain green and purple, varying in different body parts and castes. Meat ants inhabit open and warm areas in large, oval-shaped mounds that are accompanied by many entrance holes. The nest area is always cleared of vegetation and covered with materials including gravel, pebbles and dead vegetation. They are also polydomous, where a colony may be established in a series of satellite nests connected by well-defined paths and trails. Satellite nests are constructed away from the main nest and nearby areas with valuable food sources so workers can exploit them.",0

297,"Epoxy value derives from the Epoxy equivalent weight (EEW) or Weight Per Epoxide (WPE) and is a measure of the epoxy content of an epoxy resin or epoxy functional diluent. This is an important parameter as it allows determination of the correct mix ratio of an epoxy system with a curing agent. The epoxide equivalent weight is usually measured first and done by titration. The standard test method is ASTM D1652 though this has been modified by certain states of the USA. The epoxy equivalent weight (EEW) maybe defined as: the number of grams of epoxy resin required to give 1 mole of epoxy groups. The epoxy value is defined as the number of moles of epoxy group per 100g resin. Example calculations 
Polyoxypropylene diglycidyl ether a  reactive diluent with the trade name of Diluent F has an average molecular weight of 1000 and a functionality of 2 so the EEW is 1000/2 = 500.The epoxy group content (EGC) is a term which arises from the EEW and is usually found in the literature with units of m.mol/kg. So from the units it can be deduced that an epoxy resin with an EEW of 191 as above, has an epoxy group content of 1000000/191 = 5236 m.mol/kg. The epoxy value is defined as the number of moles of epoxy group per 100g resin. So as an example using the epoxy resin with an EEW of 191 and a molar mass of 382, the epoxy value is calculated as follows: 382g gives 2 moles of epoxy groups and therefore 100g = 100/382 x 2 = 0.53  i.e. the epoxy value of the resin is 0.53.",0

It is argued to be either a possible extraterrestrial impact crater or an impact structure. It lies between Bridgetown and West Dalhousie, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia, where the Bloody Creek structure straddles what was once a stretch of Bloody Creek. It also is informally known as the Astrid crater. History 
The Bloody Creek structure was discovered by Dr. George R. Stevens, a retired geologist from Acadia University, in 1987 during a regional air photo survey. By the time of its discovery, it had been submerged beneath a reservoir, Dalhousie Lake. Dalhousie Lake was created by a dam constructed across Bloody Creek by the Nova Scotia Power Corporation as part of the Bloody Creek Reservoir hydroelectric development. As a result, the collection of rock samples from crater rim and its surroundings required the use of scuba gear and visiting the site during the occasional periods when the reservoir was drained. When the surface of Dalhousie Lake was frozen, the thick ice created a platform that greatly facilitated magnetometer and ground-penetrating radar surveys of this feature. Prior to being flooded, the interior of the Bloody Creek structure consisted of a fen within the floodplain of Bloody Creek.",0

The epicenter was located near Çaldıran, 20 km northeast of Muradiye, in the Van Province of eastern Turkey. The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.3 with a maximum intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The area of severe damage, where over 80% of the buildings were destroyed, covered an area of 2,000 square kilometres. There were between 4,000 and 5,000 casualties. Tectonic setting
The easternmost part of Turkey lies within the complex zone of continuing continental collision between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The overall shortening that affects this area is accommodated partly by thrusting along the Bitlis-Zagros fold and thrust belt and partly by a mixture of sinistral strike-slip on SW-NE trending faults and dextral strike-slip on NW-SE trending faults. The earthquake was caused by movement on the Çaldıran Fault, one of the dextral faults, which had not been recognized before the earthquake. No earthquakes with magnitudes of 6 or greater were recorded within 100 km of Çaldıran in the preceding 74 years, possibly explaining why it was considered an area of only intermediate seismic risk (zone 3 out of the five-zone system of seismic risking used in Turkey at the time, with zone 1 being the highest).",0

417,"The accessus ad auctores ('introduction to authors') was a literary genre of the Middle Ages. Originally, an accessus was the introduction at the beginning of a commentary on a classical author, containing background information on the author and his work. Beginning in the 12th century, these accessus were excerpted from the commentaries and published in separate collections. It is to these collections that modern scholars give the name accessus ad auctores. Invariably written in Latin, they were designed for the use of students of Latin grammar. The standard accessus was arranged as a series of questions in the form headings followed by their answers. Four distinct schemes of organization are recognized based on the choice of headings:
The Servian sheme is based on the prologue to Virgil's Aeneid written by the 4th-century grammarian Servius. It covers seven headings: (1) the life of the poet, (2) the title of the work, (3) its genre, (4) authorial intention, (5) the number of volumes, (6) the order of the volumes and (7) an explanation or interpretation.
The rhetorical scheme is based on the septem circumstantiae (seven circumstances) of classical rhetoric: (1) who, (2) what, (3) where, (4) by what means, (5) why, (6) how and (7) when. It was favoured, for example, by the 9th-century commentator Remigius of Auxerre.
The philosophical scheme is based on Boethius' introduction to his own commentary on the Isagoge of Porphyry. It covers six headings: (1) the intention of the work, (2) its utility, (3) its internal order, (4) the name of the author, (5) the title of the work and (6) the branch of philosophy to which it belongs.
The modern scheme represents a conscious break with those that came before. It was a simplified form of the philosophical scheme and was favoured by 12th-century modernists like Conrad of Hirsau. It used three or four headings: (1) the subject matter, (2) authorial intention, (3) the utility of the work and (4) the branch of philosophy to which it belongs. Utility was sometimes dropped.",0

1234," that emphasizes the role of social interactions in shaping individual behavior and identity. It views society as an interactive system where individuals are constantly shaped by their own experiences and those around them. Interactionists believe that people are not passive recipients of culture but active participants who shape it through their own behaviors and interactions with others. They also argue that individuals do not exist in isolation, but are part of larger social systems that influence their behavior and choices.
 2 The concept of interactionism was first introduced by the British sociologist Herbert Spencer in his book ""Theory of Social and Economic Evolution"" (1857).

Its name derives from the location of the original Metropolitan Police headquarters at 4 Whitehall Place, which had a rear entrance on a street called Great Scotland Yard. The Scotland Yard entrance became the public entrance to the police station, and over time the street and the Metropolitan Police became synonymous. The New York Times wrote in 1964 that, just as Wall Street gave its name to New York's financial district, Scotland Yard became the name for police activity in London. The force moved from Great Scotland Yard in 1890, to a newly completed building on the Victoria Embankment, and the name ""New Scotland Yard"" was adopted for the new headquarters. An adjacent building was completed in 1906. A third building was added in 1940. In 1967, the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) moved its headquarters from the three-building complex to a tall, newly constructed building on Broadway in Victoria.

Comprising a keep with six inner and outer bastions, the moated stone castle covered  and had sixty-six firing positions for artillery. It cost the Crown a total of £27,092 to build the three castles of Deal, Sandown and Walmer, which lay adjacent to one another along the coast and were connected by earthwork defences. The original invasion threat passed but, during the Second English Civil War of 1648–49, Deal was seized by pro-Royalist insurgents and was only retaken by Parliamentary forces after several months' fighting. Although it remained armed, Deal was adapted by Sir John Norris and Lord Carrington during the 18th and 19th centuries to form a more suitable private house for the castle's captain, which was by now an honorary position. In 1904, the War Office concluded that the castle no longer had any value either as a defensive site or as a barracks and it was opened to the public when the captain was not in residence. Early in the Second World War, the captain's quarters were destroyed by German bombing, forcing Deal's then-captain, William Birdwood, to move to Hampton Court Palace and the castle became an observation post for an artillery battery placed along the shore line. The castle was not brought back into use as a residence and was restored by the government during the 1950s to form a tourist attraction.

273,"The caper story is a subgenre of crime fiction.  The typical caper story involves one or more crimes (especially thefts, swindles, or occasionally kidnappings) perpetrated by the main characters in full view of the reader. The actions of police or detectives attempting to prevent or solve the crimes may also be chronicled, but are not the main focus of the story.  The caper story is distinguished from the straight crime story by elements of humor, adventure, or unusual cleverness or audacity. The main characters often have comical idiosyncrasies and the law enforcement individuals are characterized by ineptitude or inadequacies. The criminals comically plan a crime with details unnecessary for the nature of the crime and humour is created when their personalities clash and their quirks are exposed.  For instance, the Dortmunder stories of Donald E. Westlake are highly comic tales involving unusual thefts by a gang of offbeat characters — in different stories Dortmunder's gang steals the same gem several times, steals an entire branch bank, and kidnaps someone from an asylum by driving a stolen train onto the property.  By contrast, the same author's Parker stories (published under the name Richard Stark) are grimly straightforward accounts of mundane crime — the criminal equivalent of the police procedural. Others, such as Lawrence Block's Bernie Rhodenbarr novels, feature a role reversal, an honest criminal and crooked cop, and the use of burglar Rhodenbarr's criminal talents to solve murders.",0

Sultan Mangogul of Congo is bored with life at court and suspects his mistress Mirzoza of infidelity. A genie presents him with a magical ring that has unique properties. When the ring is rubbed and pointed at the vagina of any woman the vagina begins speaking about its amorous experiences, to the confusion and consternation of its owner. The Sultan uses the ring about thirty times, usually at a dinner or other social gathering, and on these occasions the Sultan is typically visible to the woman. However, since the ring has the additional property of making its owner invisible when required, a few of the sexual experiences are recounted through direct observation, as the Sultan makes himself invisible in the unsuspecting woman's boudoir.",0

419,"Tongan Daopi  was a Zen Buddhist monk during the end of the Tang Dynasty and the beginning of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Very little is known about him. Traditional biographies record that he was the abbot of Tongan Monastery on Mount Fengchi near modern Nanchang. The earliest source of information on monks of this era is the Zutang ji (Patriarch's Hall Record), which was completed in 952, but it fails to mention Tongan Daopi as a disciple of his supposed teacher Yunju Daoying. The Zutang ji does, however, record someone with the name Tongan asking a question to Yunju Daoying. The scholar Ui Hakuju has written this could likely refer to Tongan Daopi. He is first explicitly mentioned in the Transmission of the Lamp, which was compiled around 1004. However, in that work, it does not mention Tongan Daopi as having any disciples. The commonly accepted version of his lineage holds that Tongan Guanzhi is Tongan Daopi's successor. However, this comes from Huihong's Sengbao zhuan, which was completed in 1119, much longer after Tongan's death than the other works. The Transmission of the Lamp instead claims that Tongan Guanzhi is the disciple of a Tongan Wei, in turn a student of Jufeng Puman, with Jufeng being an apparently obscure student of the famous Dongshan Liangjie. Both Tongan Wei and Jufeng Puman are listed for the first time in the Transmission of the Lamp, and neither with much information. However, Dayang Jingxuan, who in Huihong's version of the lineage is a descendant of Tonagan Daopi, is recorded in the Transmission of the Lamp as being descended through Jufeng Puman and Tongan Wei. Dayang was close with Wang Shu, one of the compilers of Transmission of the Lamp, suggesting that it is unlikely that an error would have been made therein about his lineage. This suggests that Tongan Guanzhi is much more likely to have been a student of Tongan Wei and not Tongan Daopi as commonly accepted. References",0

Known largely for his skills as a fielder – for he found only moderate success with the bat – Eaglestone enjoys the unusual distinction of having featured in two different County Championship-winning sides in consecutive seasons. Career
Eaglestone was drawn to cricket after leaving school in 1938 when he joined the groundstaff at Lord's Cricket Ground. He played for the Middlesex Second XI that year. A left-handed batsman, Eaglestone enjoyed limited success after a promising debut first-class game for the Marylebone Cricket Club in which he scored 77 in a 128-run partnership with Denis Compton. Having securing selection for Middlesex, he scored zero in his first outing for the county side, and though he made 55 in his next game he would score only seven half-centuries during his career and finish with a batting average of 15.77. 
 
Eaglestone played only seven matches for Middlesex in that solitary season for the club, scoring 151 runs. He decided to move to Glamorgan at the end of that year's County Championship – of which Middlesex were crowned champions. He played for Glamorgan in the 1948 season, and Glamorgan were victorious in that year's County Championship also – their maiden County Championship victory. This meant that Eaglestone had featured in Championship winning teams for two successive summers. His own contributions, however, were relatively modest.

It was originally called the Agroforestry Outreach Project (AOP). The original project spanned a decade (1981–1991), but policies from Pwojè Pyebwa continued to direct PADF tree-planting through a second decade (1992 to 2000). The project was executed throughout the country. Based on Haitian farmers’ voluntary and widespread participation, the project has been deemed a success by many. Pwojè Pyebwa distributed free trees to farmers, and advised on the incorporation of trees into existing cropping arrangements based on anthropological research into the land tenure, agricultural systems, and the historical market-orientation of Haitian peasant farmers. The project eventually won the Praxis prize in applied anthropology. It is estimated that the project involved one-third of the entire rural Haitian population. Approximately 65 million trees were planted.",0

It is commonly used in cases where the cervix is too high or tight to allow for normal labor. The device is made of soft materials such as cotton and is placed into the neck through small incisions. The goal of the procedure is to create more space between the cervix and the baby's head, which can help prevent complications during delivery. Cervical cerclage has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of premature birth, instrumental deliveries (where forceps or vacuum are used to assist with delivery), and other birthing complications. However, it is important to note that cervical cerclage does not guarantee a normal labor or delivery, and may not be appropriate for all women.",1

All six were rescued by British cave divers after spending eight days inside the cave. The incident resulted in diplomatic tension between Britain and Mexico, as the soldiers refused local help and there were rumors that they were surveying for uranium deposits. Background
The expedition members included military personnel from the Royal Navy, British Army, and Royal Air Force who were members of the Combined Services Caving Association.
In total, 12 men were part of the expedition.
The caving trip was stated as an ""official military expedition to support adventurous training.""
While six of the men were in the Alpazat caverns on an expedition expected to take 36 hours, a flash flood blocked their exit, causing them to shelter in a pre-fabricated emergency camp in a drier part of the cave.

Between the late 19th century and the early 21st century, Archaeopteryx was generally accepted by palaeontologists and popular reference books as the oldest known bird (member of the group Avialae).

731,"Length of pull (sometimes abbreviated as LOP) is the distance from the trigger to the part of a rifle or shotgun which fits against the shoulder of the shooter. Length of pull is an important ergonomic factor for ease of use; and optimum length of pull may vary with the size of the shooter, the thickness of chest clothing and body armor being worn, and whether the shooter is firing from a standing, sitting, or prone position. Variation
Many rifles and shotguns are manufactured with a standard length of pull assumed to fit most shooters. This is often approximately  for rifles and about  longer for shotguns. Shooters with short arms may find the buttstock dragging along the underside of their arm as they attempt to raise the firearm into firing position. Shooters with broad shoulders or a long neck may experience face injuries from collision with the telescopic sight or thumb of the trigger hand as the firearm recoils. Modern firearms may be equipped with a telescoping stock or removable spacers to adjust the length of pull. Gunsmiths may adjust the length of pull of custom-built firearms or older firearms by cutting off a portion of the buttstock or adding a recoil pad to the buttstock. Some sources suggest a shooter's optimum length of pull will allow the butt of the firearm to exactly reach the inside of the elbow when the hand of that arm grips the unloaded firearm with a finger on the trigger. Other sources suggest a more appropriate determination may be made using a non-firing ""try-gun"" resembling a firearm with an adjustable buttstock. When a properly adjusted try-gun is held in a firing position, the shooter's nose should be about two finger-widths behind the thumb of the trigger hand.",0
939,"A sheave  or pulley wheel is a grooved wheel often used for holding a belt, wire rope, or rope and incorporated into a pulley. The sheave spins on an axle or bearing inside the frame of the pulley. This allows the wire or rope to move freely, minimizing friction and wear on the cable. Sheaves can be used to redirect a cable or rope, lift loads, and transmit power. The words sheave and pulley are sometimes used interchangeably. Adjustable pulley
A sheave can also refer to a pulley which has an adjustable operating diameter for use with a mechanical belt. This is accomplished by constructing the pulley out of several pieces. The two main ""halves"" of the pulley can be moved closer together or farther apart, thus altering the operational diameter. The usual construction is some sort of locking collar or set screws to secure the components, one half with a threaded central shaft and one half with a threaded center. By rotating the components, one can ""screw"" the parts closer together or further apart, thus changing the distance between the two halves and allowing the belt to ride higher or lower in the groove. The adjustments are constrained to a specific range of sizes and are not limitless. One application of this is the Variomatic automatic transmission.",0

Populism in Canada has been seen as a response to what many perceive as a political system that favors special interests and elitists rather than ordinary people. Populist movements have gained traction in recent years, particularly with the rise of the Canadian Freedom Party and the People's Party of Canada, which both advocate for anti-immigrant policies and an economic nationalist agenda.

599,"The invisible hand is an economic concept that describes the unintended greater social benefits and public good brought about by individuals acting in their own self-interests. The concept was first introduced by Adam Smith in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, written in 1759. According to Smith, it is literally divine providence, that is the hand of God, that works to make this happen. By the time he wrote The Wealth of Nations in 1776, Smith had studied the economic models of the French Physiocrats for many years, and in this work, the invisible hand is more directly linked to production, to the employment of capital in support of domestic industry. The only use of ""invisible hand"" found in The Wealth of Nations is in Book IV, Chapter II, ""Of Restraints upon the Importation from Foreign Countries of such Goods as can be produced at Home.""

892,"Cervical cerclage, also known as a cervical stitch, is a treatment for cervical weakness, when the cervix starts to shorten and open too early during a pregnancy causing either a late miscarriage or preterm birth. In women with a prior spontaneous preterm birth and who are pregnant with one baby, and have shortening of the cervical length less than 25 mm, a cerclage prevents a preterm birth and reduces death and illness in the baby. The treatment consists of a strong suture sewn into and around the cervix early in the pregnancy, usually between weeks 12 to 14, and then removed towards the end of the pregnancy when the greatest risk of miscarriage has passed. The procedure is performed under local anaesthesia, usually by way of a spinal block. It is typically performed on an outpatient basis by an obstetrician-gynecologist. Usually the treatment is done in the first or second trimester of pregnancy, for a woman who has had one or more late miscarriages in the past. The word ""cerclage"" means ""hoop"" in French, as in the metal hoop encircling a barrel. There is no evidence that cerclage is effective in a multiple gestation pregnancy for preventing preterm births and reducing perinatal deaths or neonatal morbidity.",0

226,"Currency war, also known as competitive devaluations, is a condition in international affairs where countries seek to gain a trade advantage over other countries by causing the exchange rate of their currency to fall in relation to other currencies. As the exchange rate of a country's currency falls, exports become more competitive in other countries, and imports into the country become more and more expensive. Both effects benefit the domestic industry, and thus employment, which receives a boost in demand from both domestic and foreign markets. However, the price increases for import goods (as well as in the cost of foreign travel) are unpopular as they harm citizens' purchasing power; and when all countries adopt a similar strategy, it can lead to a general decline in international trade, harming all countries. Historically, competitive devaluations have been rare as countries have generally preferred to maintain a high value for their currency. Countries have generally allowed market forces to work, or have participated in systems of managed exchanges rates. An exception occurred when a currency war broke out in the 1930s when countries abandoned the gold standard during the Great Depression and used currency devaluations in an attempt to stimulate their economies. Since this effectively pushes unemployment overseas, trading partners quickly retaliated with their own devaluations. The period is considered to have been an adverse situation for all concerned, as unpredictable changes in exchange rates reduced overall international trade.",0

952,"A topological insulator is a material that behaves as an insulator in its interior but whose surface contains conducting states, meaning that electrons can only move along the surface of the material. Topological insulators have non-trivial symmetry-protected topological order; however, having a conducting surface is not unique to topological insulators, since ordinary band insulators can also support conductive surface states. What is special about topological insulators is that their surface states are symmetry-protected Dirac fermions by particle number conservation and time-reversal symmetry. In two-dimensional (2D) systems, this ordering is analogous to a conventional electron gas subject to a strong external magnetic field causing electronic excitation gap in the sample bulk and metallic conduction at the boundaries or surfaces. The distinction between 2D and 3D topological insulators is characterized by the Z-2 topological invariant, which defines the ground state. In 2D, there is a single Z-2 invariant distinguishing the insulator from the quantum spin-Hall phase, while in 3D, there are four Z-2 invariant that differentiate the insulator from “weak” and “strong” topological insulators.",0

It lives in groups of two to 70 individuals, usually splitting the group into smaller subgroups when active. Taxonomy
The taxonomy of the common woolly monkey is still debated. Fooden classified it is as one of two species under the genus Lagothrix with four sub-species (L. l. lagotricha, L. l. lugens, L. l. cana, and L. l. poeppgigii. Later, an analysis of craniodental morphology suggested a move of all sub-species to the species level and also led to the yellow-tailed woolly monkey (formerly Lagothrix flavicauda) being moved to a monotypic genus Oreonax. Genetic analyses also identify distinct groups, but different groupings from morphological and molecular data continue to make this a difficult issue that might be addressed with larger data sets. A 2014 study found the genus Lagothrix to comprise only two species: L. lagothrica and L. flavicauda, with L. lagothrica containing five subspecies; the results of this study have been followed by the American Society of Mammalogists and the IUCN Red List.",0

It was founded in 1968, following a four-year demonstration project, and is funded through property taxes and timber taxes. History
A two-year demonstration library system, the Timberland Library Demonstration (TLD), was established in 1964 to serve Grays Harbor, Lewis, Mason, Pacific, and Thurston counties, using $310,000 in funds from the federal Library Services and Construction Act and local sources.

The Timberland Library Demonstration relied on the Washington State Library to process its books, which were also stored in municipal libraries. The system debuted its bookmobile in September 1964, based in Centralia and traveling on ten routes between rural areas in all five counties. The formation of a permanent library district would require a public vote, which was pushed back from 1966 to 1968, waiting for a more favorable general election.

350,"The Physician's Visit is a 1660-1662 oil painting on a canvas painting by the Dutch artist Jan Steen, now seen in the Apsley House collection in London. Its subject is similar to his The Lovesick Maiden in the Metropolitan Museum of Art from the same era. The painting is a representation of how women were treated when treated by doctors in the 1600s. The painting features several small details and disguised symbolism that may go unnoticed to the common eye, but nevertheless contribute to the painting's meaning. Visual Analysis 
This painting is a visual representation of medical practices that were performed on women in the 1660s. Jan Steen uses very direct facial expressions to show what the people in this painting were feeling. Women in paintings such as this and The Lovesick Maiden  are usually young, pretty and well dressed, while being positioned upward in a chair. The facial expressions in these paintings often had a vacant and senseless look while the doctor takes the woman's pulse. In other similar examples, the doctor may also be looking at the urine sample that an assistant holds up to the light.  The backgrounds of these paintings tend to have elegant paintings on the walls..The woman sitting down on the right is suffering from illness, which during the time was not only hard to identify, but also extremely difficult to treat. Paintings consistently represent women in a fragile, passive, housebound way which was much more of a  male wish, rather than a female reality. Women in these paintings are often presented to be weak, and surrounded by concerned family members.",0

One such haltija is called etiäinen—an image, doppelgänger, or just an impression that goes ahead of a person, doing things the person in question later does. For example, people waiting at home might hear the door close or even see a shadow or a silhouette, only to realize that no one has yet arrived. Etiäinen can also refer to some kind of a feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes it could, for example, warn of a bad year coming. In modern Finnish, the term has detached from its shamanistic origins and refers to premonition. Unlike clairvoyance, divination, and similar practices, etiäiset (plural) are spontaneous and can't be induced. Quite the opposite, they may be unwanted and cause anxiety, like ghosts. Etiäiset need not be too dramatic and may concern everyday events, although ones related to e.g. deaths are common. As these phenomena are still reported today, they can be considered a living tradition, as a way to explain the psychological experience of premonition.",0

It was built by Gabriel von Seidl from 1903 to 1905 and is named after the Ruffiniturm (""Ruffini tower"", demolished in 1808), which in turn was named after Johann Baptista Ruffini. The Ruffiniturm formed the original Sendlinger Tor (""Sendlinger gate"") and thus was part of Munich's first city wall. The three-sided house that borders the Sendlinger Street and Pettenbeck Street stands on what was the fluvial terrace of the first medieval fortification's moat, as can still be seen today when viewed from the southeast.  This is a prominent site by virtue of both being a historical location and marking the transition point between the oldest core of the city and its first expansion in the 13th century. The Bavarian Office of Monument Preservation describes the building as ""romantic-native mood architecture of the highest level for the interpretation of a historicist image of an old town as seen under a picturesque ideal, which was meant to be 'upgraded'.""

235,"In micro-sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective that sees social behavior as an interactive product of the individual and the situation. In other words, it derives social processes (such as conflict, cooperation, identity formation) from social interaction, whereby subjectively held meanings are integral to explaining or understanding social behavior. This perspective studies the ways in which individuals shape, and are shaped by, society through their interactions. Interactionism thus argues that the individual is an active and conscious piece of the social-context system, rather than merely a passive object in their environment. It believes interactions to be guided by meanings that are attached to the self, to others with whom each individual interacts, and to situations of interaction; all of which are altered in interaction themselves. In this sense, interactionism may stand in contrast to studies of socialization, insofar as interactionism conceives individuals to influence groups at least as much as groups influence individuals.",0

The TDR process can be considered a tool for controlling urban sprawl by concentrating development. TDR is a legal mechanism offered in some local government jurisdictions as a form of development control. In the United States, TDR are also a way to avoid constitutional takings issues caused by rezoning areas that would otherwise eliminate a significant amount of value from the property. The procedure offers landowners financial incentives or bonuses for the conservation and maintenance of the environmental, heritage or agricultural values of their land. TDR is based on the concept that with land ownership comes the right of use of land, or land development. These land-based development rights can in some jurisdictions be used, unused, sold, or otherwise transferred by the owner of a parcel. ",0

It is possible to determine the torque associated with the point of application of a net force so that it maintains the movement of jets of the object under the original system of forces. Its associated torque, the net force, becomes the resultant force and has the same effect on the rotational motion of the object as all actual forces taken together.  It is possible for a system of forces to define a torque-free resultant force. In this case, the net force, when applied at the proper line of action, has the same effect on the body as all of the forces at their points of application.

This field examines change across three major dimensions, which are physical development, cognitive development, and social emotional development. Within these three dimensions are a broad range of topics including motor skills, executive functions, moral understanding, language acquisition, social change, personality, emotional development, self-concept, and identity formation. Developmental psychology examines the influences of nature and nurture on the process of human development, as well as processes of change in context across time.

Practitioners of therapeutic touch state that by placing their hands on, or near, a patient, they are able to detect and manipulate what they say is the patient's energy field. One highly cited study, designed by the then-nine-year-old Emily Rosa and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1998, found that practitioners of therapeutic touch could not detect the presence or absence of a hand placed a few inches above theirs when their vision was obstructed.

941,"A sky anchor is a system of two balloons in tandem, with a ""zero-pressure"" lifting gas balloon tethered to a superpressure balloon ""anchor"". The gas balloon is filled with a lifting gas and provides the buoyancy, while the superpressure balloon is filled with air, and pressurized to provide the desired ballast weight. In a passive sky anchor, the superpressure balloon is sealed, while in an active system, its pressure can be varied. Both versions have been tested in flight, but have had frequent failures with only occasional successful outcomes. The tandem arrangement makes launching difficult, and this complexity can lead to mission failure. The tandem balloon system is intended to increase the flight time of the zero-pressure balloon by damping the diurnal  altitude variations caused by solar heating of the lifting gas and its subsequent expansion. As the balloons descend, the superpressure balloon's constant volume displaces a larger mass of the denser air, and becomes more buoyant. Likewise as they rise, the system displaces less air mass, limiting the ascent to prevent the lifting gas from expanding too far and escaping from the zero pressure balloon.",0

737,"Allan Fulton Worthington (born February 5, 1929), nicknamed ""Red"", is a former professional baseball pitcher. He played all or part of 14 seasons in Major League Baseball for the New York / San Francisco Giants (1953–54, 1956–59), Boston Red Sox (1960), Chicago White Sox (1960), Cincinnati Reds (1963–64) and Minnesota Twins (1965–69). Worthington batted and threw right-handed. Raised in Birmingham, Alabama, Worthington played baseball at the University of Alabama before becoming a professional. Acquired by the Giants in 1953, he began his career with the ballclub as a starter, pitching two shutouts in his first two major league games. After spending most of 1954 and all of 1955 in the minor leagues, he became a full-time starter again in 1956. During 1957–58, he split his time between the rotation and the bullpen, and by 1959 he was almost exclusively used as a relief pitcher. He split 1960 between the Red Sox, the minor leagues, and the White Sox, retiring with about a month left in the season because the White Sox were engaged in ruses to steal opposing team's signs, and he could not play for the team with a clear conscience. He completed his degree at Howard College, then decided to return to baseball and spent two years in the minor leagues for the White Sox. The Reds acquired him in 1963, and Worthington posted a 2.99 earned run average (ERA) out of the bullpen for them that year. He began 1964 with Cincinnati, was sent to the minor leagues, and had his contract purchased by the Twins, whom he would spend the rest of his career with. Sports Illustrated called his 1.37 ERA with the team that year ""impressive."" In 1965, Worthington had a career-high 21 saves and a career-low 2.13 ERA, also winning 10 games. From 1966 to 1967 he saved 32 games, and in 1968 he led American League (AL) relievers with 18 saves.

Medicine includes the process by which the cell(s) in the body regenerate and repair to reduce the size of a damaged or necrotic area and replace it with new living tissue. The replacement can happen in two ways: by regeneration in which the necrotic cells are replaced by new cells that form ""like"" tissue as was originally there; or by repair in which injured tissue is replaced with scar tissue. Most organs will heal using a mixture of both mechanisms. Within surgery healing is more often referred to as recovery, and postoperative recovery has historically been viewed simply as restitution of function and readiness for discharge. More recently, postoperative recovery has been described as an energy‐requiring process to decrease physical symptoms, reach a level of emotional well‐being, regain functions, and re‐establish activities",0

According to this theory, space and time emerged together  ago, and the universe has been expanding ever since. While the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown, the cosmic inflation equation indicates that it must have a minimum diameter of 23 trillion light years, and it is possible to measure the size of the observable universe, which is approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter at the present day. The earliest cosmological models of the universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the center. Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal gravitation, Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion and observations by Tycho Brahe.",0

They are carnivorous, feeding upon the eggs of various planthoppers in the family Delphacidae, and thus are important in the biological control of pests. The genus is distributed throughout the Holarctic of the Northern Hemisphere, but species are also found in the tropics, in China, South America, Australia, and the Indo-Pacific. Type species
In 1860 Gustav Flor described a bug he found in Estonia and named it Capsus geminus. When Fieber established the genus Tytthus in 1864, he named two species to the genus, Zetterstedt's Capus pygmaeus and Flor's Capus geminus. Capus geminus thus became Tytthus geminus, by which name it was known as for well over a hundred years. In 1906 Kirkaldy named then Tytthus geminus as the type species for the genus. But, as Henry and Wheeler discovered in 1988, the name Capsus geminus was not available in 1860, because Thomas Say had already used it 1832 for another species entirely. So, after researching the various previous nomenclaturial acts regarding the bug, they discovered that the next available name was one used by Harry H. Knight in 1931 to describe the same bug as if it were a new species, but placing it in the genus Cyrtorhinus Fieber, 1858 as Reuter had made Tytthus a junior synonym of Cyrtorhinus. Knight's name, Cyrtorhinus pubescens was the oldest junior synonym. In 1992, Wheeler and Henry published a treatise reviewing the Miridae family occurring in the Holarctic, and formally corrected the nomenclaturial error in accordance with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, with the result that the type species was henceforth called Tytthus pubescens (Knight, 1931).",0

The manuscript collection contains five epic poems: Asadi Tusi's Garshasp-nama, Ahmad Tabrizi's Šāhanšāh-nāma, Tāriḵ-e Čangiz Ḵān va Jānešinānaš (""The History of Genghis Khan and his Successors"") the Bahman-nama, and the Kush-nama. It originally also contained the Shahnameh, however the Shahnameh portion was separated from the rest of the codex. It is likely that much of the epic was based on one or more Middle Persian prose texts. This manuscript has 10,129 couplets and contains some scribal errors. The text can be divided into a preface, a frame story about a king named Kush (different from the main character), a second frame story about Alexander the Great, and the main narrative which tells the story of Kush the Tusked and his battles with Abtin and Fereydun and their adventures in China, Korea, the Maghreb, and the Iberian Peninsula.",0
381,"The Carracci  were a Bolognese family of artists that played an instrumental role in bringing forth the Baroque style in painting. Brothers Annibale (1560–1609) and Agostino (1557–1602) along with their cousin Ludovico (1555–1619) worked collaboratively. The Carracci family left their legacy in art theory by starting a school for artists in 1582. The school was called the Accademia degli Incamminati, and its main focus was to oppose and challenge Mannerist artistic practices and principles in order to create a renewed art of naturalism and expressive persuasion. Art theory
The artistic and theoretical activity of the Carracci is recognized by critics and historians such as André Chastel and Giulio Carlo Argan to have decisively contributed to the formation of the figurative Baroque and to new pictorial solutions based on the recuperation of the classical and Renaissance tradition, renewed by study of nature. ""Jointly they effected an artistic reform that overthrew Mannerist aesthetics and initiated the Baroque.""",0

His collection of myriapod specimens, today housed in the Natural History Museum of Vienna, includes many type specimens. His monographs on the myriapods of the Austro-Hungarian Empire were the first comprehensive treatments of the large region's centipede and millipede faunas. He named nearly 130 taxa of millipedes (1 genus, 2 subgenera, 69 species and 56 variations) and over 40 centipede groups (2 genera, 29 species and 12 variations), as well as four taxa each of pauropods and symphylans. His work on millipedes pioneered the use of gonopods in millipede classification and species recognition. At least three authors have honored Latzel by naming a genus Latzelia (Scudder 1890, Bollman 1893, Verhoeff, 1895).

Angered by the working conditions in coal mines, Goodwin sought to increase wages and improve working conditions, and fought companies that disregarded workers' rights. He participated in and led multiple strikes, and served as a delegate for the British Columbia Federation of Labour and as an organizer for the Socialist Party of Canada. In the years following his increased activism and involvement with labour unions, Goodwin fell under scrutiny for his opposition to military conscription during World War I. He was killed by a police officer in 1918. There is debate on whether Goodwin was a victim of murder or if his death was the result of the officer's self-defence. His death sparked a one-day general strike in Vancouver on August 2, 1918, which was the first general strike ever held in Canada. The strike was a precursor of the Winnipeg general strike of 1919 and other labour conflicts. Early life and radicalization

The process of healing can be influenced by various factors such as genetics, environment, lifestyle, and medical treatment. For example, if a person has a genetic predisposition to certain diseases or conditions, their risk of developing them may increase. Similarly, environmental factors such as pollution, stress, and trauma can also impact the body's ability to heal. Lifestyle choices such as diet, exercise, and mental health can also play a role in promoting healing. Additionally, medical treatments such as surgery, radiation therapy, and medication can affect the body's ability to recover. ",1

It is thus based on the concept of figure–ground from Gestalt psychology. For example, in a street map with strong figure-ground contrast, the reader would be able to isolate and focus attention on individual features, like a given street, park, or lake, as well as layers of related features, like the street network. Strong figure-ground contrast has been seen as a desirable goal of map design, because it helps the map reader to perceive distinct geographic phenomena in the map. This allows more complex composition techniques such as visual hierarchy to organize these phenomena into clear structures that help readers use the map for its intended purposes.",0

41,"In visual physiology, adaptation is the ability of the retina of the eye to adjust to various levels of light. Natural night vision, or scotopic vision, is the ability to see under low-light conditions. In humans, rod cells are exclusively responsible for night vision as cone cells are only able to function at higher illumination levels. Night vision is of lower quality than day vision because it is limited in resolution and colors cannot be discerned; only shades of gray are seen.  In order for humans to transition from day to night vision they must undergo a dark adaptation period of up to two hours in which each eye adjusts from a high to a low luminescence ""setting"", increasing sensitivity hugely, by many orders of magnitude.  This adaptation period is different between rod and cone cells and results from the regeneration of photopigments to increase retinal sensitivity. Light adaptation, in contrast, works very quickly, within seconds. Efficiency 
The human eye can function from very dark to very bright levels of light; its sensing capabilities reach across nine orders of magnitude. This means that the brightest and the darkest light signal that the eye can sense are a factor of roughly 1,000,000,000 apart. However, in any given moment of time, the eye can only sense a contrast ratio of 1,000. What enables the wider reach is that the eye adapts its definition of what is black.",0

667,"The Order of Monfragüe  was a Spanish military order founded at the castle of Monfragüe near Plasencia on the Tagus in 1196. The order was founded by the knights of the Order of Mountjoy who dissented from a merger with the Knights Templar. The order never prospered and on 23 May 1221, by order of Ferdinand III of Castile, it was merged into the Order of Calatrava. Formation
In the twelfth century Monfragüe was the centre of a Mountjoy commandary before it became the headquarters of its own order. The earliest reference to the commandary is in an economic transaction involving the commander, Gonzalo Padilla, and his fellow brothers (freyes, freires) of the Order. As early as 1186 the Order had tried to amalgamate with the Templars but failed. The remaining decade of its existence was spent in a state of utter collapse. The Order was united in December 1187 with the Hospital of the Holy Redeemer, but already a distinction had appeared in its ranks between the master of the order, Fralmo, and his followers on one hand and the commander of the Order in the Kingdom of Castile, Rodrigo González, and his support. By mid-1188 there was a schism in the Order, though it does not appear to have broken down along the lines Castile and León on one hand and the Crown of Aragon on the other, as sometimes supposed. When the final split occurred in 1196, over the successful amalgamation with the Templars, all opponents of the merger would have had to leave the lands of Alfonso II of Aragon, a strong supporter of the Temple.",0

President Ulysses S. Grant signed the act the day before his inauguration for a second term to double the salary of the president and those of Supreme Court Justices. The proposal for a salary increase was fueled by what was considered low pay for members in government, while the salary for the president was the same as it had been for George Washington. The bill subsequently included a 50 percent salary increase for the president and for members of Congress, retroactive to the beginning of their term, which was the most highly contested provision in the bill. Public outcry led Congress to rescind the congressional salary increase. As a protest against the act, Ohio ratified what later became the Twenty-seventh Amendment.

656,"Supported employment refers to service provisions wherein people with disabilities, including intellectual disabilities, mental health, and traumatic brain injury, among others, are assisted with obtaining and maintaining employment. Supported employment is considered to be one form of employment in which wages are expected, together with benefits from an employer in a competitive workplace, though some versions refer to disability agency paid employment. Companies such as Skilcraft in the United States are an example of ""supported employment"" which is defined in law for state and federal reimbursements (by person not by agency or corporation). Community foundations of supported employment
Supported employment was developed in the United States in the 1970s as part of both vocational rehabilitation (VR) services (e.g., NYS Office of Vocational Services, 1978) and the advocacy for long term services and supports (LTSS) for individuals with significant disabilities in competitive job placements in integrated settings (e.g., businesses, offices, manufacturing facilities). Since the mid-1980s, supported employment in the professional literature primarily has referred to the ""individual placement"" model, either with job coaches or through ""natural supports"" models. The critical issue in supported employment (SE) was viewed as the need for funding for long-term services and supports (LTSS) in the community often termed beyond ""case closure"" (Griffin, Test, Dalton, & Wood, 1995). Supported employment is worldwide in 2013, though moving to new inclusive models, and the term has been used for assisting workers of diverse kinds who may need an extra jump start in the workplace; it is still associated with its roots in disability which includes community integration and deinstitutionalization",0

An early case in which charges of judicial murder were raised was the Amboyna massacre in 1623, which caused a legal dispute between the English and Dutch governments over the conduct of a court in the Dutch East Indies that had ordered the execution of ten English men accused of treason. The dispute centered around differing interpretations of the legal jurisdiction of the court in question. The English believed that this court had not been competent to try and execute these EIC members, and so believed the executions to have been fundamentally illegal, thus constituting ""judicial murder"". The Dutch, on the other hand, believed the court to have been fundamentally competent, and wished to focus instead on misconduct of the particular judges in the court.",0

463,"Egernia is a genus of skinks (family Scincidae) that occurs in Australia. These skinks are ecologically diverse omnivores that inhabit a wide range of habitats. However, in the loose delimitation (which incorporates about 30 species) the genus is not monophyletic but an evolutionary grade, as has long been suspected due to its lack of characteristic apomorphies. Some of the skinks traditionally placed in Egernia appear to be among the most intelligent squamates. They have been shown to be able to distinguish between relatives and unrelated conspecifics, and can recognize relatives individually. Several species form monogamous pair-bonds. For instance, the Black Rock Skink is a species who can perform kin discrimination based on scent and form monogamous pair-bonds and a nuclear family structure. Most of these species belong to Egernia sensu stricto, and similar behaviour is also known in the related Solomon Islands skink (Corucia zebrata). The latter means that the high intelligence and social skills are probably plesiomorphic for the Egernia genus-group as a whole, and that the solitary species appear to have evolved towards being less intelligent and social again. It may still be, however, that the intelligent behaviour is a homoplasy that evolved several times in the Egernia genus-group; the fact that Corucia is a monotypic and rather distinct genus makes it impossible to decide at present.",0

869,"Cirquent calculus is a proof calculus that manipulates graph-style constructs termed cirquents, as opposed to the traditional tree-style objects such as formulas or sequents. Cirquents come in a variety of forms, but they all share one main characteristic feature, making them different from the more traditional objects of syntactic manipulation. This feature is the ability to explicitly account for possible sharing of subcomponents between different components. For instance, it is possible to write an expression where two subexpressions F and E, while neither one is a subexpression of the other, still have a common occurrence of a subexpression G (as opposed to having two different occurrences of G, one in F and one in E). Overview
The approach was introduced by G. Japaridze in  as an alternative proof theory capable of “taming” various nontrivial fragments of his computability logic, which had otherwise resisted all axiomatization attempts within the traditional proof-theoretic frameworks. The origin of the term “cirquent” is CIRcuit+seQUENT, as the simplest form of cirquents, while resembling circuits rather than formulas, can be thought of as collections of one-sided sequents (for instance, sequents of a given level of a Gentzen-style proof tree) where some sequents may have shared elements.

334,"The Woman's Tribune was an American newspaper founded in Beatrice, Nebraska, by women's suffrage activist Clara Bewick Colby. In print from 1883 to 1909, and published in Beatrice and in Washington, D.C., the newspaper connected radical feminism with women's culture on the Midwestern frontier. Throughout its run, its slogan was ""Equality Before the Law.""  Unlike other suffrage papers that focused on urban culture and politics, The Woman's Tribune'''s appeal to the rural and everyday woman made it one of the most powerful voices of feminist ideology during its day. Colby routinely included generalist news, suffrage news, book reviews, travelogues, editorials, and even poetry in the paper. Some stories and features were intended to be read to children, presumably by their mothers, making the Tribune unusual in its explicitly multi-generational audience. Despite lack of financial support from national suffrage organizations, Colby managed to keep the Tribune in production for its 26 years; she wrote, edited, copyedited, and even at times typeset the paper. Advertising focused on products and services provided by and for women. Notices of events in the international suffragist community appeared as well, connecting women on the American frontier to women's suffrage campaigns in Europe and Asia. Colby met and corresponded with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony; she frequently published their work in the Tribune although she received little, if any, financial support from their political orgazniation. Bloomberg has argued that the Woman's Tribune'' was unique among women's suffrage publications in that it argued for full equality under the law for Native and indigenous people (women and men); the core audience of the paper, however, like its founding editor, was in the white, literate middle-class.

430,"Cleanliness is both the abstract state of being clean and free from germs, dirt, trash, or waste, and the habit of achieving and maintaining that state. Cleanliness is often achieved through cleaning. Culturally, cleanliness is usually a good quality, as indicated by the aphorism: ""Cleanliness is next to Godliness"", and may be regarded as contributing to other ideals such as health and beauty. In emphasizing an ongoing procedure or set of habits for the purpose of maintenance and prevention, the concept of cleanliness differs from purity, which is a physical, moral, or ritual state of freedom from pollutants. Whereas purity is usually a quality of an individual or substance, cleanliness has a social dimension and direction or implies a system of interactions. ""Cleanliness,"" observed Jacob Burckhardt, ""is indispensable to our modern notion of social perfection."" A household or workplace may be said to exhibit cleanliness, but not ordinarily purity; cleanliness also would be a characteristic of the people who maintain cleanness or prevent dirtying.",0

405,"A brass quintet is a five-piece musical ensemble composed of brass instruments. The instrumentation for a brass quintet typically includes two trumpets or cornets, one French horn, one trombone or euphonium/baritone horn, and one tuba or bass trombone. Musicians in a brass quintet may often play multiple instruments. Trumpet players for instance may double on piccolo trumpets and flugelhorns. There can be variation in instrumentation depending on the type of quintet. In some quintets, the horn is replaced by an additional trombone. Euphonium may also be substituted for the trombone part. While the tuba is considered a standard, the range and style of many pieces lend themselves to being played with bass trombone as the lowest-pitched instrument. Additionally, some pieces call for the use of percussion instruments, particularly the snare drum, tambourine, or timpani. History 
The earliest brass chamber music was written in the mid to late 1800s and coincided with the invention of brass instruments that could play chromatically. The Distin family formed one of the first brass quintets in 1833, touring Europe and the United States to promote a new family of brass instruments called saxhorns. French composer Jean-François Bellon and Russian composer Victor Ewald, led the development of brass chamber music in Paris and Russia during this period. Bellon published the first series of twelve brass quintets in 1850 while Ewald composed his quintets between the years 1888 and 1912 all while improvements were being made to brass instruments. The improvement of brass instruments played a big role later on in the history of brass quintets as it allowed the player to do more with the instrument which in turn allowed for more artistry.  ",0

Originating from a sprawling disturbance near the Gulf of Tehuantepec, south of Mexico, in mid-October 2015, Patricia was first classified a tropical depression on October 20. Initial development was slow, with only modest strengthening within the first day of its classification. The system later became a tropical storm and was named Patricia, the twenty-fourth named storm of the annual hurricane season. Exceptionally favorable environmental conditions fueled explosive intensification on October 22. A well-defined eye developed within an intense central dense overcast and Patricia grew from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in just 24 hours—a near-record pace. On October 23, the hurricane achieved its record peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 215 mph (345 km/h). This made it the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Western Hemisphere and the strongest globally in terms of one-minute maximum sustained winds. Late on October 23, dramatic weakening ensued and Patricia made landfall near Cuixmala, Jalisco, with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h). This still made it the strongest landfalling Pacific hurricane on record. Patricia continued to weaken extremely quickly, faster than it had intensified, as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of Mexico.

865,"In propositional calculus, a propositional function or a predicate is a sentence expressed in a way that would assume the value of true or false, except that within the sentence there is a variable (x) that is not defined or specified (thus being a free variable), which leaves the statement undetermined. The sentence may contain several such variables (e.g. n variables, in which case the function takes n arguments). Overview
As a mathematical function, A(x) or A(x, x, ..., x), the propositional function is abstracted from predicates or propositional forms.  As an example, consider the predicate scheme, ""x is hot"".  The substitution of any entity for x will produce a specific proposition that can be described as either true or false, even though ""x is hot"" on its own has no value as either a true or false statement.  However, when a value is assigned to x , such as lava, the function then has the value true; while one assigns to x a value like ice, the function then has the value false.",0

745,"The Vanishing Lady (, literally ""Magical Disappearance of a Lady at the Théâtre Robert-Houdin"") is an 1896 French short silent trick film directed by Georges Méliès. It features Méliès and Jehanne d'Alcy performing a trick in the manner of a stage illusion, in which D'Alcy disappears into thin air. A skeleton appears in her place before she finally returns for a curtain call.  The film, shot outdoors in Méliès's garden on a platform decorated with theatrical scenery, is based on a famous stage illusion by Buatier de Kolta, in which a woman disappeared by escaping through a hidden trapdoor. However, using an editing technique known as the substitution splice, Méliès carried out the trick using cinematic special effects rather than conventional stage machinery. The substitution splice also allowed Méliès to add new material to the end of the trick, inventing the appearance and transformation of the skeleton prop and d'Alcy's return. The film, notable as Méliès's first known use of cinematic special effects, survives in film archives; a hand-colored version has also been reconstructed by a Méliès scholar.",0

The architectural historian John Newman notes the ""historically"" important existence of a raised cruck truss in the hall of the house which he suggests places it as a transitional building between the traditional, single-level, Welsh hall house and later, storeyed, buildings.

459,"Political jurisprudence is a legal theory that some judicial decisions are motivated more by politics than by unbiased judgment. According to Professor Martin Shapiro of University of California, Berkeley, who first noted the theory in 1964: ""The core of  political jurisprudence is a vision of courts as political agencies and judges as political actors."" Legal decisions are no longer focused on a judge's analytical analysis (as in Analytical jurisprudence), but rather it is the judges themselves that become the focus for determining how the decision was reached. Political jurisprudence advocates that judges are not machines but are influenced and swayed by the political system and by their own personal beliefs of how the law should be decided. That is not to say necessarily that judges arbitrarily make decisions they personally feel should be right without regard to stare decisis. Instead they are making decisions based on their political, legal, and personal beliefs as it relates to the law. Deeply, and with more implication for the society, the decisions of the judges are not only modified from the politics, but modify itself the politics and the process of law making in a so influential way, that we can say that the policy-making is ""judicialized"". Shapiro noted political jurisprudence as having two wings, the macro wing and the micro wing. The macro wing looks at courts as players in the political process. In their processes of decision making, they entertain matters from different interest groups hence shape policy through pressure from these. the micro wing looks at individual decisions of judges. The second wing is a manifestation of Charles H. Pritchett who introduced behaviorism into USA judicial studies after studies that showed individual decisions in courts have been increasing since the days of President Roosevelt.",0

101,"A secretory protein is any protein, whether it be endocrine or exocrine, which is secreted by a cell. Secretory proteins include many hormones, enzymes, toxins, and antimicrobial peptides.
Secretory proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Production
The production of a secretory protein starts like any other protein. The mRNA is produced and transported to the cytosol where it interacts with a free cytosolic ribosome. The part that is produced first, the N-terminal, contains a signal sequence consisting of 6 to 12 amino acids with hydrophobic side chains. This sequence is recognised by a cytosolic protein, SRP (Signal Recognition Particle), which stops the translation and aids in the transport of the mRNA-ribosome complex to an SRP receptor found in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. When it arrives at the ER, the signal sequence is transferred to the translocon, a protein-conducting channel in the membrane that allows the newly synthesized polypeptide to be translocated to the ER lumen. The dissociation of SRP from the ribosome restores the translation of the secretory protein. The signal sequence is removed and the translation continues while the produced chain moves through the translocon (cotranslational translocation).",0

252,"The Bendidia was an ancient Athenian festival celebrating the Thracian goddess Bendis.  It was celebrated on the 19th day of the month of Thargelion (late May, in the Gregorian calendar), and was introduced in 429 BC.  The festival took place in the Piraeus.  It was rare for ancient Athens to permit foreign residents of the city to worship their own gods; the cult of Bendis and the Bendidia is one of a few exceptions, driven by the strategic importance of Thrace to Athens at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War. The Bendidia began with a procession to the sanctuary of Bendis.  Worshippers coming from Athens processed from the Prytaneion, while the Thracian worshippers of Bendis in the Piraeus organised a separate procession, possibly organised so that it would join up with the Athenian contingent before they arrived at the sanctuary.  The procession from Athens – six miles from the sanctuary – was provided with sponges and basins in which to wash, and garlands; the celebrants then ate lunch in the precinct of the sanctuary.  After dark, there was a horseback relay race, with the riders passing torches.  The horseback race was a Thracian feature of the festival, as such races at Athenian festivals were usually performed on foot, and Thracians were famous for their equestrianism, though it is unknown if similar races were also held in Thrace itself.

Jacob Adler remarks that as the only Lithuanian Jew in the early years of Yiddish theater, he deliberately spoke a different dialect of Yiddish on stage so that it would blend better with the other actors. (The Yiddish of Lithuania differed from that of Ukraine and Romania.) Although his early performances with Goldfaden are usually considered the start of professional Yiddish-language theater, as a Broder singer Grodner was already something of an actor, and he had already participated in an 1873 concert in Odessa, Ukraine in which he and other Broder singers sang songs (including some of Goldfaden's) and improvised comic material between songs that was very similar to Goldfaden's early, highly improvised, comic musical plays. Actor Jacob Adler, already a big fan of the highly regarded Russian language theater in Odessa at that time, and who saw Grodner perform in taverns and restaurants, indicates in his memoir the strong impression Grodner made on him for how well he portrayed his characters. Lulla Rosenfeld writes that Grodner was known in Odessa as ""Srolikl Papirosnik"" (from papiros, cigarette) because he always had a cigarette dangling from his lip.",0

982,"Mass amateurization refers to the capabilities that new forms of media have given to non-professionals and the ways in which those non-professionals have applied those capabilities to solve problems (e.g. create and distribute content) that compete with the solutions offered by larger, professional institutions. Mass amateurization is most often associated with Web 2.0 technologies. These technologies include the rise of blogs and citizen journalism, photo and video-sharing services such as Flickr and YouTube, user-generated wikis like Wikipedia, and distributed accommodation services such as Airbnb. While the social web is not the only technology responsible for the rise of mass amateurization, Clay Shirky claims Web 2.0 has allowed amateurs to undertake increasingly complex tasks resulting in accomplishments that would seem daunting within the traditional institutional model. In addition to whole websites and applications, Web 2.0 has also birthed a variety of digital tools that facilitate organization and problem solving on a large scale. These tools include tags, trackbacks, and hashtags. These new forms of media became widely available during the first decade of the 21st century due in part to the fall of transactional costs of creating and distributing media. Mass amateurization is a social, cumulative and collaborative activity, wherein ideas will flow back up the pipeline from consumers and they will share them among themselves.",0

Kolderup Rosenvinge og W. Johannsen. He took his Ph.D. from the same university in 1930. From 1934 to 1960, he was superintendent at the Botanical Museum of the University of Copenhagen. Hagerup’s scientific works concern evolution, polyploidy and pollination, among other things. He showed that the tetraploid Empetrum hermaphroditum is a separate species from the diploid Empetrum nigrum. He thereby initiated the use of chromosome numbers in systematic botany, a field later known as cytotaxonomy. He put forward the hypothesis that the ploidy level is an important factor in the distribution and ecology of plant species. In contrast, another of his scientific ideas has been disproven by later modern research – the idea of a direct ancestry of the centrosperms (approximately equal to Caryophyllales) from the gymnospermous Gnetophyta and, hence, two separate evolutionary lineages within the flowering plants. Many of Hagerup’s studies were concerned with plant species of the Ericaceae, Empetraceae and related families, or ’’Bicornes’’ as they were known in the Wettstein system.",0

518,"In cryptography, a timing attack is a side-channel attack in which the attacker attempts to compromise a cryptosystem by analyzing the time taken to execute cryptographic algorithms. Every logical operation in a computer takes time to execute, and the time can differ based on the input; with precise measurements of the time for each operation, an attacker can work backwards to the input. Finding secrets through timing information may be significantly easier than using cryptanalysis of known plaintext, ciphertext pairs. Sometimes timing information is combined with cryptanalysis to increase the rate of information leakage. Information can leak from a system through measurement of the time it takes to respond to certain queries. How much this information can help an attacker depends on many variables: cryptographic system design, the CPU running the system, the algorithms used, assorted implementation details, timing attack countermeasures, the accuracy of the timing measurements, etc. Timing attacks can be applied to any algorithm that has data-dependent timing variation. Removing timing-dependencies is difficult in some algorithms that use low-level operations that frequently exhibit varied execution time.",0

501,"The concept of business process orientation (BPO) is based upon the work of Deming (Walton, 1996), Porter (1985), Davenport and Short (1990), Hammer (1993, 1996 and 1999), Grover et al. (1995), and Coombs and Hull (1996).  This body of work suggests that firms could enhance their overall performance by adopting a “process view” of the organization.  Although many firms have adopted the BPO concept, little to no empirical data existed substantiating its effectiveness in facilitating improved business performance.  McCormack (2000) conducted an empirical study to explore the relationship between BPO and enhanced business performance. The research results showed that BPO is critical in reducing conflict and encouraging greater connectedness within an organization, while improving business performance. Moreover, companies with strong measures of BPO showed better overall business performance. The research also showed that high BPO levels within organizations led to a more positive corporate climate, illustrated through better organizational connectedness and less internal conflict. Another empirical study by Kohlbacher (2009) reveals that BPO is positively associated with customer satisfaction, product quality, delivery speed and time-to-market speed. For a central concept, one that has become something of a Holy Grail for 1990s managers, BPO has remained remarkably hard to pin down.  Its champions argue that it is a new approach to management that replaces the rigid hierarchies of the past (""I report to my boss"") with structures that are much flatter, more cooperative, more process-oriented  (""I report to my customer."").  Many of us have had experience with both types of organization and we know intuitively what BPO feels like.

A music video was made, featuring a model and dancer lip-syncing the song on a red sofa, wearing yellow sweater and beret. Background and release
Before going under the name Motiv 8, Steve Rodway released mostly underground tracks under different names in the early 90's. One of these was an early version of ""Rockin' for Myself"". He thought it sounded much more commercial than the other and when the demand for underground techno began to fall off, he recorded a new version of the track, which would become a massive hit in clubs. Warner Records signed him and a new remix was released, reaching the Top 20 in the UK. From then, Rodway stuck with the name Motiv 8. He told in an interview, that because of the song's success, Jarvis Cocker of Pulp approaced him, asking for a remix of ""Common People"". The following success of that remix played a big part in establishing the name Motiv 8, according to Rodway.",0

With its headquarters at Atlantic Road, Brixton (and later at Waterloo Road, London) and grocery shops across southern England, it was a rival to the Sainsbury's chain, John and Mary Sainsbury having opened their first grocery shop in Holborn one year earlier. A deep personal rivalry developed between the two families, because of acrimonious feelings about the Greigs' alleged betrayal of a verbal agreement regarding the purchasing of sites for development. The David Greig chain is considered to have been established in 1870, when the wife of a Hornsey cabinet maker of Scots birth opened a small provisions shop at 32 High Street, Hornsey. By 1881 her son David Greig had joined her in the business and described himself as a 'provision dealer' in the census of that year. The business thrived and wishing to expand beyond Hornsey, Greig opened his first shop at 54-58 Atlantic Road, Brixton in 1888, initially ""anchoring"" the nascent Brixton Market, which started in Atlantic Road in the 1870s and was so successful that it spread to Brixton Road before being relocated to Brixton Station Road plus several purpose built covered arcades and finally also Electric Avenue, to reduce congestion and allow further growth. Around 1890 a second shop was opened at nearby Loughborough Junction, near Brixton.

750,"Adverse possession, sometimes colloquially described as ""squatter's rights"", is a legal principle in the Anglo-American common law under which a person who does not have legal title to a piece of property—usually land (real property)—may acquire legal ownership based on continuous possession or occupation of the property without the permission (licence) of its legal owner. The possession by a person is not adverse if they are in possession as a tenant or licensee of the legal owner. In general, a property owner has the right to recover possession of their property from unauthorised possessors through legal action such as ejectment. However, in the English common law tradition, courts have long ruled that when someone occupies a piece of property without permission and the property's owner does not exercise their right to recover their property for a significant period of time, not only is the original owner prevented from exercising their right to exclude, but an entirely new title to the property ""springs up"" in the adverse possessor. In effect, the adverse possessor becomes the property's new owner. Over time, legislatures have created statutes of limitations that specify the length of time that owners have to recover possession of their property from adverse possessors. In the United States, for example, these time limits vary widely between individual states, ranging from as low as three years to as long as 40 years.",0

310,"In economics, the Edgeworth conjecture is the idea, named after Francis Ysidro Edgeworth, that the core of an economy shrinks to the set of Walrasian equilibria as the number of agents increases to infinity. The core of an economy is a concept from cooperative game theory defined as the set of feasible allocations in an economy that cannot be improved upon by subset of the set of the economy's consumers (a coalition). For general equilibrium economies typically the core is non-empty (there is at least one feasible allocation) but also ""large"" in the sense that there may be a continuum of feasible allocations that satisfy the requirements. The conjecture basically states that if the number of agents is also ""large"" then the only allocations in the core are precisely what a competitive market would produce. As such, the conjecture is seen as providing some game-theoretic foundations for the usual assumption in general equilibrium theory of price taking agents. In particular, it means that in a ""large"" economy people act as if they were price takers, even though theoretically they have all the power to set prices and renegotiate their trades. Hence, the fictitious Walrasian auctioneer of general equilibrium, while strictly speaking completely unrealistic, can be seen as a ""short-cut"" to getting the right answer.",0

This means that there is no electric charge separation between the interior and exterior of the material, and the material behaves as an insulator on both sides. The concept was first proposed by Klaus von Klitzing in 1985[1] and has since been explored for a variety of materials, including metals, semiconductors, and superconductors.

For example, they may have zero electrical resistance on one side but non-zero resistance on the other side, depending on the direction of the external electric field. They may also exhibit quantum Hall effect behavior, where the electron density is quantized in a specific range of frequencies. These properties make topological insulators important for electronic devices and spintronics, as well as for fundamental physics research",1

Claims of its destruction in 1988 caused tensions over the political future of Nagorno-Karabakh and encouraged civil and inter-ethnic unrest that would eventually erupt into the first Nagorno-Karabakh War. History
Topkhana is the name of a gently-sloping hillside opposite (and visible from) the town of Shusha, but separated from the town by deep gorge containing the Karkar (also known as the Dashalty) river. Its name derives from it being the location of cannons (""top"" in Turkic languages) of Mohammad Khan Qajar during his siege of Shusha in 1795. The forest was mentioned in Anar Rzayev's novel The Last Night of the Expiring Year first published in 1970.

When Jarvis left the show in 1951, film star Eddie Albert took his place and co-hosted with White for six months until thirty-three and a half hours of live ad-lib television per week, featuring just the two of them, took its toll and he also resigned. White was then hosting the show alone, and is believed to have been the first female television talk show host as a result. After a period of White talking directly into the camera lens for hours at a stretch, the show began accepting guests to interact with her as well as gradually incorporating scripts and sketches.  Similar to Jackie Gleason's Honeymooners sketches on the Dumont Network during the same era, recurring sketches involving White as a housewife named Elizabeth caught on with the viewers to the point that expanding the sketches into a half-hour sitcom appeared to be the obvious next step. Series pianist George Tibbles began writing the sketches. Studio producer Don Fedderson, Tibbles and White formed a production company called ""Bandy Productions,"" named after Betty White's dog Bandit, and White changed over to a half hour sitcom format based on the Elizabeth sketches entitled Life With Elizabeth, which ran in syndication for two years and sixty-five episodes.

The route runs from U.S. Route 322 Business (US 322 Bus.) in West Chester east to PA 611 in Philadelphia. The route begins in downtown West Chester and heads east out of the borough as a one-way pair of streets. Between West Chester and Upper Darby, PA 3 follows a four-lane divided highway named West Chester Pike through suburban areas. Along this stretch, the route passes through Edgmont, Newtown Square, Broomall, and Havertown. The route has an interchange with Interstate 476 (I-476) between Broomall and Havertown. Upon reaching Upper Darby, PA 3 heads into Philadelphia along Market Street. In Philadelphia, the route follows multiple one-way pairs, running along Chestnut Street eastbound and Walnut Street westbound in West Philadelphia before heading into Center City Philadelphia along Market Street eastbound and John F. Kennedy Boulevard westbound and ending at Philadelphia City Hall. Philadelphia and West Chester were linked by a dirt road dating back to 1793. The Philadelphia and West Chester Turnpike Company was created to build a toll road between the two places in 1848. The turnpike was built as a plank road between Philadelphia and Newtown Square in the 1850s before becoming a stone road in the 1880s. A horse-drawn rail line was built along part of the turnpike in the 1850s and a trolley service was introduced in the 1890s. The state took over the West Chester Pike in 1918. In 1927, the route was designated as part of PA 5. PA 3 replaced the PA 5 designation between West Chester and Philadelphia in 1937.

623,"An airliner is a type of aircraft for transporting  passengers and air cargo.  Such aircraft are most often operated by airlines.  Although the definition of an airliner can vary from country to country, an airliner is typically defined as an airplane intended for carrying multiple passengers or cargo in commercial service. The largest of them are wide-body jets which are also called twin-aisle because they generally have two separate aisles running from the front to the back of the passenger cabin. These are usually used for long-haul flights between airline hubs and major cities. A smaller, more common class of airliners is the narrow-body or single-aisle. These are generally used for short to medium-distance flights with fewer passengers than their wide-body counterparts. Regional airliners typically seat fewer than 100 passengers and may be powered by turbofans or turboprops. These airliners are the non-mainline counterparts to the larger aircraft operated by the major carriers, legacy carriers, and flag carriers, and are used to feed traffic into the large airline hubs.

151,", also known as Attorney General v Ahkter, is an English family law Court of Appeal case concerning the validity of an Islamic ceremony of marriage. A woman who recently divorced her husband petitioned the court to determine whether the marriage, resulting from a Nikah, was void marriage or a non-marriage. The Family Court had held the marriage was void, granting her financial remedies. The Court of Appeal subsequently reversed the decision and denied financial remedies. The case received much scholarly and media attention on the requirements for marriage and the protection of vulnerable spouses. Context 
The Marriage Act 1949 and Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 set out conditions for a marriage ceremony to be recognized as valid, void, voidable or outside the Marriage Acts. A valid marriage satisfies all the conditions in the Marriage Acts; the parties may benefit from all the legal consequences such as equitable division of property and pension sharing. A void marriage fails one of the 'essential requirements' in the Marriage Act; a decree of nullity can be granted which allows the parties to get the same financial remedies as on divorce. A voidable marriage is one that can be annulled at the option of one of the parties if one of the grounds are met. A 'non-marriage' is outside the Marriage Acts, with the parties treated as cohabiting couples.",0

The family is distinguished from most other flies by the possession of ""eyestalks"": projections from the sides of the head with the eyes at the end. Some fly species from other families such as Drosophilidae, Platystomatidae, Richardiidae, and Tephritidae have similar heads, but the unique character of the Diopsidae is that their antennae are located on the stalk, rather than in the middle of the head as in all other flies.

The modern city of Domokos occupies its site. At this place, says Livy, the traveller, after traversing rugged mountains and intricate valleys, comes suddenly in sight of an immense plain like a vast sea, the extremity of which is scarcely visible. From the astonishment which it excited in the traveller, the city was supposed to have derived its name. It stood upon a lofty and precipitous rock. It was besieged by Philip V of Macedon in 199 BCE; but a reinforcement of Aetolians having made their way into the town, the king was obliged to abandon the siege. Thaumaci was taken by the consul Acilius in the war with Antiochus, 191 BCE. The modern town of Domokos occupies the site of Thaumaci, and at this place inscriptions were found containing the ancient name.

779,"Floyd Alburn Firestone (1898–1986) was an acoustical physicist, who in 1940 while a professor at the University of Michigan invented the first practical ultrasonic testing method and apparatus. He was granted US Patent 2,280,226 for the invention in 1942. Manufactured by Sperry Corporation, the testing device was known variously as the Firestone-Sperry Reflectoscope, the Sperry Ultrasonic Reflectoscope, the Sperry Reflectoscope and sometimes also just as a Supersonic Reflectoscope, the name Firestone had originally coined for the instrument. The technology is not just used in quality control in factories to reject defective parts before shipment, but also revolutionized transportation safety. For example, ultrasonic testing is used for safety maintenance inspection of railroad cars, particularly axles and wheels, aircraft, particularly fuselages, and other transportation vessels for material fatigue. Dr. Firestone’s ultrasonic pulse echo technique for metal defect testing was also later applied in medical diagnosis, giving birth to the field of Echocardiography and to the field of Medical Ultrasonography, generally. Dr. Firestone was the editor of the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America from 1939-1957. Among Firestone’s many other inventions in his field are in a single year an “automatic device for the minute inspection of flaws”, “a new and useful improvement in hook-up of electrical apparatus”, and “[a] device for measuring noise”, and, even, later a “musical typewriter”. In 1933, Firestone proposed an alternative to the mechanical–electrical analogy of James Clerk Maxwell in which force is made the analogy of voltage (the impedance analogy).  Firestone's analogy (now called the mobility analogy) makes force the analogy of current.  In this work he introduced the concept of ""through"" and ""across"" variables and demonstrated that there were analogies for these variables in other energy domains, making it possible to treat a complex system as a unified whole in analysis.  Firestone's analogy became popular amongst mechanical filter designers because it has the property of preserving network topologies when transforming between the mechanical and electrical domains.",0

5,"Moluccans are the Austronesian-speaking and Papuan-speaking ethnic groups indigenous to the Maluku Islands, also called the Moluccas and historically known as the Spice Islands, which as a region has been annexed by Indonesia since the end of 1950. As such, ""Moluccans"" is used as a blanket term for the various ethnic and linguistic groups native to the islands.
	
The original inhabitants of the Maluku Islands were Austronesian and Melanesian in origin. Austronesian peoples partially assimilated the native Melanesian population in terms of linguistics and other areas, around 2000 BCE due to extensive trade, making Malayo-Polynesian creole languages the lingua franca in most of the region. Later added to this were several Dutch, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Arabian and English influences due to colonization, marriage with foreign traders during the Silk-route era and Middle ages, and even with European soldiers during the World Wars. A small number of German descendants was added to Moluccan population, especially in Ambon, along with arrival of Protestant Missionaries since 16th century. Moluccans are predominantly Christian like many other Melanesians, but Muslim villages are also present. Despite religious differences, all groups share strong cultural bonds and a sense of common identity, such as through Adat, Pela and Bongso traditions. Music is also a binding factor, playing an important role in the cultural identity. Moluccans historically tend to be a musically gifted people, excelling in creative areas such as singing and sports. In recognition, the Moluccan capital city of Ambon was awarded the official status of City of Music by UNESCO in 2019.",0
753,"Rye is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 5,543 at the 2020 census. The town is home to several state parks along the Atlantic coastline. History
The first settlement in New Hampshire, originally named Pannaway Plantation, was established in 1623 at Odiorne's Point by a group of fishermen led by David Thompson. The settlement was abandoned in favor of Strawbery Banke, which became Portsmouth. The first settler in present-day Rye was probably William Berry. Prior to its incorporation in 1726 as a parish of New Castle, Rye was called ""Sandy Beach"" and its lands were once parts of New Castle, Portsmouth, Greenland and Hampton. In 1726, the town of New Castle set off a parish for Sandy Beach called ""Rye"", for Rye in Sussex, England, the ancestral lands of the Jenness family who continue to live in the town to this day and even have a beach named after them. The town was incorporated in 1785. In 2013, a researcher pointed out that the town seal showed the parish creation date of 1726 as the incorporation date.

49,"In mathematics, an almost periodic function is, loosely speaking, a function of a real number that is periodic to within any desired level of accuracy, given suitably long, well-distributed ""almost-periods"". The concept was first studied by Harald Bohr and later generalized by Vyacheslav Stepanov, Hermann Weyl and Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch, amongst others. There is also a notion of almost periodic functions on locally compact abelian groups, first studied by John von Neumann. Almost periodicity is a property of dynamical systems that appear to retrace their paths through phase space, but not exactly. An example would be a planetary system, with planets in orbits moving with periods that are not commensurable (i.e., with a period vector that is not proportional to a vector of integers). A theorem of Kronecker from diophantine approximation can be used to show that any particular configuration that occurs once, will recur to within any specified accuracy: if we wait long enough we can observe the planets all return to within a second of arc to the positions they once were in.",0

Dagmar Burešová, a young female lawyer, became part of his legacy by defending Palach's family in a trial against the communist government, a regime which tried to dishonour Palach’s sacrifice, a heroic action for the freedom of Czechoslovakia. The fight for freedom, for moral principles, self-sacrifice and protest in those desperate times led to the moral unification of a repressed nation, which twenty years later defeated the totalitarian regime. The anniversary of Jan Palach’s death inspired a new generation of students to start protests that led to the eventual fall of communism in Czechoslovakia, part of the eventual destruction of the Iron Curtain.",0

296,"An elder or progenitor race, in science fiction, fantasy, or horror fiction, is an ancient race that not only preceded but helped shape the races that followed, often playing a significant role in the basis of the story. Humanity may have been descended from them, or they may be a different fictional race, such as elves, dwarves, or aliens. While in some cases, whether they currently exist is unclear, in other instances, members of an elder race still inhabit the world, either openly or in secret. In order to hide their existence, they may make use of a wainscot society, inhabit a parallel universe, only visiting the current one occasionally, or disguise themselves as a fool, deity, magician or trickster. One such example is in Lord of Light (1967), where highly advanced humans take on the identities of Hindu deities and act as gods to the less advanced colonists. Elder races are typically either technologically or spiritually powerful, as well as wise. While sometimes benevolent, assisting younger races, they can also often be amoral, as in H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, where the Elder Gods are indifferent to humanity's ""petty"" concerns. They are usually presented as having drifted apart from humanity in the present of the story, sometimes as lost empires whose inhabitants either left their former home for a new one, or were destroyed by a catastrophe and only live on in legend, such as Atlantis. They may appear both as enemies, or as allies against a greater threat.",0

The book is a comparative history of the cities of Richland, in the northwest United States adjacent to the U.S. Department of Energy Hanford Site plutonium production area, and Ozersk, in Russia's southern Ural mountain region. These two cities were home to the world's first plutonium production sites, and in Plutopia Brown charts the environmental and social impacts of those sites on the residents of and the environment surrounding the two cities. Brown argues that the demands of plutonium production – both the danger of the physical process and the secrecy required in the Cold War context – led both US and Soviet officials to create ""Plutopias,"" ideal communities to placate resident families in exchange for their cooperation and control over their bodies. This entailed creating significant state-run welfare programs along with high levels of consumerism in both places.

2,"In mathematics, specifically differential calculus, the inverse function theorem gives a sufficient condition for a function to be invertible in a neighborhood of a point in its domain: namely, that its derivative is continuous and non-zero at the point. The theorem also gives a formula for the derivative of the inverse function.
In multivariable calculus, this theorem can be generalized to any continuously differentiable, vector-valued function whose Jacobian determinant is nonzero at a point in its domain, giving a formula for the Jacobian matrix of the inverse. There are also versions of the inverse function theorem for complex holomorphic functions, for differentiable maps between manifolds, for differentiable functions between Banach spaces, and so forth. Statement
For functions of a single variable, the theorem states that if  is a continuously differentiable function with nonzero derivative at the point ; then  is invertible in a neighborhood of , the inverse is continuously differentiable, and the derivative of the inverse function at  is the reciprocal of the derivative of  at :",0

806,"Coutoucou Hubert Maga (August 10, 1916 – May 8, 2000) was a politician from Dahomey (now known as Benin). He arose on a political scene where one's power was dictated by what region in Dahomey one lived in. Born a peasant in 1916, Maga served as a schoolmaster from 1936 to 1945, during which time he gradually gained considerable influence among the uneducated. He was elected to Dahomey's territorial assembly in 1947 and founded the Northern Ethnical Group, later renamed the Dahomey Democratic Rally (Rassemblement Démocratique du Dahomé). In 1951, Maga was elected to the French National Assembly, where he served in various positions, including premier from 1959 to 1960. When Dahomey gained its independence from France on August 1, 1960, Maga was appointed to the presidency, and was officially elected to that post on December 11. During Maga's term of office, Dahomey's economy collapsed; there was little foreign investment and unemployment rose. In response, he launched a four-year plan in January 1962, the basis of which was to increase agricultural production by forcing the nation's youths to work on the land. Maga also faced a national crisis of unity, culminating in a failed assassination plot against him in May 1961 led by the main opposition leader, Justin Ahomadegbé-Tomêtin. Ahomadegbé-Tomêtin was jailed, and by the time of his release in November 1962, a one-party state had been established and the opposition press had been restricted. In 1963, convicted murderer Christophe Bokhiri was released from prison, prompting riots around the country, but the focus of the rioting soon shifted toward Maga's problems as president. The riots became so serious that the Chief of Staff of the Dahomeyan Army, Christophe Soglo, took control of the country in October to prevent a civil war. After forcing Maga to resign, Soglo gave him, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, and vice president Sourou Migan Apithy, the titles of Minister of State.",0

Water from the Luggie eventually ends up in the west in the Firth of Clyde via the River Kelvin which joins the Luggie at Kirkintilloch. Water from the Red Burn on the other hand flows northward and then eastward via the Bonny Water and the River Carron into the Firth of Forth. Cumbernauld can be considered the aquatic heart of Scotland, being the urban watershed between East and West in the centre of the Central Belt. Where exactly the Scottish watershed is located in the town is difficult to pinpoint. The catchment of both streams (and the River Avon) includes areas of Fannyside Muir. The Red Burn enters Cumbernauld behind Cumbernauld Academy (formerly Cumbernauld High), whereas the Luggie Water flows past Luggiebank close to the Greenfaulds railway station. Therefore, anywhere between these two landmarks may be the aquatic heart of Scotland.

Strange was apparently born in Aylsham, in Norfolk, England, tentatively given as 1826 by his earliest biographer although more likely to between 1810 and 1818. He emigrated to South Australia in 1836 aboard the Cygnet, or at least prior to 1838 when he accompanied Charles Sturt on an expedition to the Gawler River. A saltwater water body to which he led the party, from which he had profitably fished sometime earlier, was later named for him as Strange's Creek.

Faith de Villiers was born in Johannesburg, the largest city in the Transvaal and the center of gold mining and industry in South Africa. Her father was a descendant of French Huguenots who had come to the Dutch Cape Colony in the days of early settlement. Most such families learned Afrikaans and were assimilated into Afrikaner culture, because of similarities in their Protestant religious beliefs, and most had stayed in the Cape Province. Faith's ancestors had moved north to Johannesburg, however, and had become resolutely Anglophonic and Anglophilic, speakers of English and lovers of all things British. She began her dance training at an early age, with Delphine Thompson, a pupil of one of the founders of the Cecchetti Society in South Africa.

712,"The Wealden hall house is a type of vernacular medieval timber-framed hall house traditional in the south east of England. Typically built for a yeoman, it is most common in Kent (hence ""Wealden"" for the once densely forested  Weald) and the east of Sussex but has also been built elsewhere.  Kent has one of the highest concentrations of such surviving medieval timber-framed buildings in Europe. The original floor plan usually had four bays with the two central ones forming the main hall open to the roof with the hearth in the middle and two doors to the outside at one end forming a cross passage. The open hearth was later moved towards the cross passage and became a fireplace with chimney, sometimes the chimney pile even blocking the cross passage, which had soon been screened off the main hall. Beyond the cross passage the outer bay at the ""screens end"" or ""lower end"" of the hall, usually contained two rooms commonly called buttery and pantry, while the rooms in the bay at the other end, the ""upper end"", were called parlours. The end bays each had an upper floor containing solars, which did not communicate with each other, as the hall rose to the rafters between them. The upper stories on both ends typically extended beyond the lower outer wall being jettied on at least one side of the building. As the main hall had no upper floor the outer wall ran straight up without jettying, and thus the central bays appeared recessed.

They are non-pigmented, in contrast to other plastids such as the chloroplast. Lacking photosynthetic pigments, leucoplasts are not green and are located in non-photosynthetic tissues of plants, such as roots, bulbs and seeds. They may be specialized for bulk storage of starch, lipid or protein and are then known as amyloplasts, elaioplasts, or proteinoplasts (also called aleuroplasts) respectively. However, in many cell types, leucoplasts do not have a major storage function and are present to provide a wide range of essential biosynthetic functions, including the synthesis of fatty acids such as palmitic acid, many amino acids, and tetrapyrrole compounds such as heme. In general, leucoplasts are much smaller than chloroplasts and have a variable morphology, often described as amoeboid. Extensive networks of stromules interconnecting leucoplasts have been observed in epidermal cells of roots, hypocotyls, and petals, and in callus and suspension culture cells of tobacco. In some cell types at certain stages of development, leucoplasts are clustered around the nucleus with stromules extending to the cell periphery, as observed for proplastids in the root meristem.",0

239,"A  goldsmith banker was a business role that emerged in seventeenth century London from the London goldsmiths where they gradually expanded their services to include storage of wealth, providing loans, transferring money and providing bills of exchange that would lead to the development of cheques.  Some of the concepts were brought over from Amsterdam where goldsmiths would provide gold storage and issue chits that started to be used as a means of exchange.  The goldsmith banker became a key development in the history of banking that would lead to modern banking. History
Their emergence was gradual: exchanging goldsmiths, who dealt in coinage, started to become recognised as carrying out a different activity from a working goldsmith in the 1630s. Prior to that date banking in London was principally carried out by foreigners, generally Italians, Germans, and the Dutch. However this innovation led to an indigenous banking tradition. The seizure of the mint by Charles I in 1640 created anxiety about the safe storage of valuables, which was further increased during the English Civil War, which also disrupted the regular work of the working goldsmiths. They soon developed accountancy practices to keep track of deposits. Then they also started paying interest on deposits so they could loan out increasing quantities of gold. The depositor was given a receipt with their name and the amount of the deposit. Such receipts became negotiable and thus evolved into the bank note.",0

The M-88 was designed to address the shortcomings of the Tumansky M-87.  The improvements incorporated in the M-88 were a strengthened crankcase, crankshaft, connecting rods, waffle ribbing at the piston bottom and a two speed geared centrifugal supercharger.  The M-88 retained the same bore/stroke and displacement as the M-87 while increasing power to 1,000-1,150 hp.  Design work began in 1937 and by 1939 the first prototypes were being flight tested in the Polikarpov I-180 fighter prototypes.  At first the M-88 was not a success, but the designers persisted and the M-88 was made into a reliable and widely produced engine.  There were a number of different variants with the most numerous being the M-88B, of which 10,585 were produced at Zaporozhye and Omsk.  The M-88B solved most of the mechanical failures associated with the M-87 and early M-88's by including oil injectors in the crankshaft, improved cooling and strengthened drive components.  16,087 M-88's were produced.

222,"Tolerable daily intake (TDI) refers to the daily amount of a chemical that has been assessed safe for human being on long-term basis (usually whole lifetime). Originally acceptable daily intake (ADI) was introduced in 1961 to define the daily intake of a food additive which, during the entire lifetime, appears to be without appreciable risk. For contaminants and other foreign chemicals not used intentionally, the term TDI is often preferred. Both ADI and TDI are usually assessed based on animal experiments, and it is most often hundreds of times lower than the dose causing no observable adverse effect (NOAEL) in the most sensitive tested animal species. Because the uncertainty factors (safety factors) may vary depending on the quality of data and the type of adverse effect, TDI values are not good estimates of the harmfulness of chemicals, and must be considered administrative tools to set allowable limits for chemicals, rather than scientific measures. The threshold limit value (TLV) of a chemical substance is a level to which it is believed a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime without adverse effects. References",0

282,"Global aphasia is a severe form of nonfluent aphasia, caused by damage to the left side of the brain, that affects receptive and expressive language skills (needed for both written and oral language) as well as auditory and visual comprehension. Acquired impairments of communicative abilities are present across all language modalities, impacting language production, comprehension, and repetition. Patients with global aphasia may be able to verbalize a few short utterances and use non-word neologisms, but their overall production ability is limited. Their ability to repeat words, utterances, or phrases is also affected. Due to the preservation of the right hemisphere, an individual with global aphasia may still be able to express themselves through facial expressions, gestures, and intonation. This type of aphasia often results from a large lesion of the left perisylvian cortex. The lesion is caused by an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and is associated with damage to Broca's area, Wernicke's area, and insular regions which are associated with aspects of language. Signs and symptoms
It is most common for the onset of global aphasia to occur after a thrombotic stroke (at the trunk of the middle cerebral artery), with varying severity. The general signs and symptoms include the inability to understand, create, and repeat speech and language.  These difficulties also persist in reading, writing, and auditory comprehension abilities.
Verbal language typically consists of a few recognizable utterances and words (e.g., hello), overlearned phrases (e.g., how are you), and expletives (e.g., a curse word). However, those affected by global aphasia may express themselves using facial expressions, intonation, and gestures.  Extensive lexical (vocabulary) impairment is possible, resulting in an inability to read simple words or sentences. Global aphasia may be accompanied by weakness of the right side of the face and right hemiplegia (paralysis), but can occur with or without hemiparesis (weakness). Additionally, it is common for an individual with global aphasia to have one or more of the following additional impairments: apraxia of speech, alexia, pure word deafness, agraphia, facial apraxia, and depression.",0

Primarily utilizing a Toyo-Field 45CF 4-by-5 camera, Nick Albertson's  work combines photography, video, and sculptural forms. Albertson's recent body of work utilizes the repetitive patterning of everyday household items such as rubber bands, cups, straws, paper napkins, and plastic bags. When framed through Nick Albertson's photographic lens, these mundane objects undergo a transformation. Through patterning, light and shadow, sculptural formations, and post-production editing, Albertson's work blurs the lines between abstraction and representation, playing to the repetitive nature of the objects in question and the viewer's familiarity with common household products. ""In my work, I strip utilitarian objects of their functions, repurposing them to create visceral experiences."" One reviewer noted that in some of Albertson's works, it is obvious to tell which household or office item he is utilizing in his works. Others, not so much. The repeated motif leads towards abstraction in a way that is both mesmerizing and deceptive.",0

It was published in Chicago by the general executive board of the IWW from 1921 to 1926, under various editors. The precursor of the Industrial Pioneer was the One Big Union Monthly. The editor of One Big Union Monthly, John Sandgren, used his position to wage war on the Communists in the IWW. When his editorials became too sectarian, the IWW replaced him as editor in 1931, and changed the name of the publication to the Industrial Pioneer. The new editor was a Communist, however, and this alienated the non-Communist majority of IWW members. He was removed as editor in 1922. By the end of 1923, the IWW publications Industrial Pioneer and Industrial Worker were both nearly bankrupt.

It is the first planet candidate to claim to be detected with this method. The discovery reported the planet candidate to have mass of 3.2 times Jupiter's (assuming an edge-on orbit), semi-major axis of 1.7 AU, and orbital period of 1,170 days. The planet candidate was discovered in March 2007 and published in September 2007.

Its existence has been called into question with further monitoring of the pulsations of the star which show deviations from the predicted behavior if this were in fact a planet. The variations in the pulsations may be due to unknown stellar variability.",0

Very little remains above ground of the Dorset Cursus, which once stretched for 10 km (6¼ miles) through the undulating chalkland of Cranborne Chase in east Dorset, from Martin Down to Thickthorn Down (both near the A354 road). It is by far the largest example of this class of ancient monument: it is over three times longer than the archetypical Great Cursus near Stonehenge.

The  long river is one of the longest on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense and forms the natural borders of Cundinamarca and Boyacá and Boyacá and Santander in its upstream and downstream part respectively. The river formed the trajectory for the Spanish conquest of the Muisca, when the conquistadors went uphill into the Andes from the tropical lowlands of Barrancabermeja in the north. The difference in altitude along the river course, from  at the source to  at its mouth, in its  large basin causes climatic variations, especially with respect to precipitation.

720,"Ballet as a music form progressed from simply a complement to dance, to a concrete compositional form that often had as much value as the dance that went along with it. The dance form, originating in France during the 17th century, began as a theatrical dance. It was not until the 19th century that ballet gained status as a “classical” form. In ballet, the terms ‘classical’ and ‘romantic’ are chronologically reversed from musical usage. Thus, the 19th century Classical period in ballet coincided with the 19th century Romantic era in music. Ballet music composers from the 17th–20th centuries, including the likes of Jean-Baptiste Lully, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Igor Stravinsky, and Sergei Prokofiev, were predominantly in France and Russia. Yet with the increased international notoriety seen in Tchaikovsky's and Stravinsky's lifetime, ballet music composition and ballet in general spread across the western world. History
Until about the second half of the 19th century, the role of music in ballet was secondary, with the main emphasis on dance, while music was simply a compilation of danceable tunes. Writing ""ballet music"" used to be a job for musical craftsmen, rather than for masters. For example, critics of the Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840–1893) mentioned his writing of ballet music as something demeaning.",0

228,"A self bow or simple bow is a bow made from a single piece of wood. Extra material such as horn nocks on the ends, or built-up handles, would normally be accepted as part of a self bow. Some modern authorities would also accept a bow spliced together in the handle from two pieces of wood. Comparison with composite bows 
An effective self bow can be made from widely available local material in most inhabited parts of the world, with limited tools whose functions include chopping, shaving, and scraping. A day of work may be needed, starting with a seasoned stave; a composite bow requires a week's work, and could possibly take up to several years, starting with a much greater range of materials and skills. Self bows must be approximately the height of the archer if they are to allow a long draw, and they are less efficient in the specialized art of flight archery.  Well-designed composite bows of high draw-weight give higher arrow velocity, and the bow itself is shorter. However, the hide glue that holds a composite bow together absorbs water and will dissolve if soaked; the wood of self bows is less sensitive to humidity. ",0

It is known from several skulls and partial remains of vertebrae and limbs. It has large orbits, or eye sockets, and large otic notches (rounded indentations at the back of the skull). A bone called the palatine, which is usually found on the underside of the skull, is partially exposed on the top of the skull.

Another distinguishing feature of Perryella is the presence of two small projections on the quadratojugal bone at the back of the skull. The lowermost projection forms a cup-like shape that attaches to the lower jaw. The classification of Perryella was at first uncertain because it shared features with two groups, Trimerorhachidae and Dissorophoidea, which were thought to be distantly related.

590,"In macroeconomics, the classical dichotomy is the idea, attributed to classical and pre-Keynesian economics, that real and nominal variables can be analyzed separately. To be precise, an economy exhibits the classical dichotomy if real variables such as output  and real interest rates can be completely analyzed without considering what is happening to their nominal counterparts, the money value of output and the interest rate. In particular, this means that real GDP and other real variables can be determined without knowing the level of the nominal money supply or the rate of inflation.  An economy exhibits the classical dichotomy if money is neutral, affecting only the price level, not real variables. As such, if the classical dichotomy holds, money only affects absolute rather than the relative prices between goods. The classical dichotomy was integral to the thinking of some pre-Keynesian economists (""money as a veil"") as a long-run proposition and is found today in new classical theories of macroeconomics. In new classical macroeconomics there is a short-run Phillips curve which can shift vertically according to the rational expectations being reviewed continuously. In the strict sense, money is not neutral in the short-run, that is, classical dichotomy does not hold, since agents tend to respond to changes in prices and in the quantity of money through changing their supply decisions. However, money should be neutral in the long run, and the classical dichotomy should be restored in the long-run, since there was no relationship between prices and real macroeconomic performance at the data level. This view has serious economic policy consequences. In the long-run, owing to the dichotomy, money is not assumed to be an effective instrument in controlling macroeconomic performance, while in the short-run there is a trade-off between prices and output (or unemployment), but, owing to rational expectations, government cannot exploit it in order to build a systematic countercyclical economic policy.",0

The properties were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 and 15 November 2002 respectively. History 
Waverley Reservoir No. 1, completed in 1887, was the last of four reservoirs built to augment the Botany Swamps Scheme (1858-1886). The other three reservoirs included: 
 Crown Street Reservoir, 1859
 Paddington Reservoir, 1864 (disused and no longer owned by Sydney Water), and 
 Woollahra Reservoir, 1880. 
However Waverley Reservoir (Elevated) was not supplied solely by Botany Swamps Water, because by 1886 the Hudson Scheme had come on line, supplying water from the Upper Nepean, prior to the completion of that Scheme in 1888. Water was pumped from Woollahra Reservoir for the first six years of its service, then from Crown Street Reservoir in 1893. From 1927 onwards Waterloo Pumping Station took over supply of the reservoir. The Waverley Reservoirs were the highest of the reservoirs intended to be supplied by Botany Swamps. However it soon became apparent that additional height was required for reticulation purposes. This led to the construction of two elevated steel tanks in 1894 (now demolished). With increasing demand, these tanks were eventually superseded by the present Waverley Reservoir (Elevated) and Waverley Reservoir No. 2, both completed in 1917.

Full-time employment often comes with benefits that are not typically offered to part-time, temporary, or flexible workers, such as annual leave, sick leave, and health insurance. Part-time jobs are mistakenly thought by some to not be careers. However, legislation exists to stop employers from discriminating against part-time workers so this should not be a factor when making decisions on career advancement. They generally pay more than part-time jobs per hour, and this is similarly discriminatory if the pay decision is based on part-time status as a primary factor. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer (US Department of Labor). The definition by the employer can vary and is generally published in a company's Employee Handbook. Companies commonly require from 32 to 40 hours per week to be defined as full-time and therefore eligible for benefits.",0

The Fender Performer Bass was a uniquely styled bass guitar, designed by John Page, and renowned for its extremely slender neck (narrower than Stratocaster and Telecaster guitars). The Japanese Performer Standard has an alder body, with a bolt-on 34"" 24-fret micro-tilt adjustable maple neck and a 2-octave rosewood fingerboard, as opposed to the United States-made Performer Elite, which sports an ebony fretboard.

17,"Death of Cook is the name of several paintings depicting the 1779 death of the first European visitor to the Hawaiian Islands, Captain James Cook at Kealakekua Bay.  
Most of these paintings seem to go back to an original by John Cleveley the Younger, painted in 1784, although other versions, like that of John Webber, stood model for later copies too. Such artworks were reproduced in paint and engraving over the course of modern world history.  The much more famous reproductions, like the one at the Honolulu Museum of Art (allegedly based on the Cleveley version), often depicted Cook as a peacemaker trying to stop the fighting between his sailors and the native Hawaiians that they had challenged in combat. However, in 2004, the original Cleveley painting was discovered in a private collection belonging to a family since 1851. James, Cleveley's brother was a member of Cook's crew, and the painting is said to concur with his drawings and eyewitness accounts.  The original depicted Cook involved in hand-to-hand combat with the native Hawaiians.  The discovery of the original painting has not changed the way most historians view Cook's relationship with the Hawaiians, as during his last voyage, Cook was reported by his contemporaries to have become irrationally violent.

186,"The Capparaceae (or Capparidaceae), commonly known as the caper family, are a family of plants in the order Brassicales. As currently circumscribed, the family contains 33 genera and about 700 species. The largest genera are Capparis (about 150 species), Maerua (about 100 species), Boscia (37 species) and Cadaba (30 species). Taxonomy 
The Capparaceae have long been considered closely related to and have often been included in the Brassicaceae, the mustard family (APG, 1998), in part because both groups produce glucosinolate (mustard oil) compounds. Subsequent molecular studies support Capparaceae sensu stricto as paraphyletic with respect to the Brassicaceae. However Cleome and several related genera are more closely related to members of the Brassicaceae than to the other Capparaceae. These genera are now either placed in the Brassicaceae (as subfamily Clemoideae) or segregated into the Cleomaceae. Several more genera of the traditional Capparaceae are more closely related to other members of the Brassicales, and the relationships of several more remain unresolved. Based on morphological grounds and supported by molecular studies, the American species traditionally identified as Capparis have been transferred to resurrected generic names. Several new genera have also been recently described.",0

45,"In combat sports such as boxing, an orthodox stance is one in which the boxer places their left foot farther in front of the right foot, thus having their weaker side closer to the opponent. Because it favors the stronger, dominant side—often the right side, see laterality—the orthodox stance is the most common stance in boxing and MMA. It is mostly used by right-handed boxers. Many boxing champions have fought in an orthodox stance. Alternative stances
The corresponding designation for a left-handed boxer is southpaw and is generally a mirror image of the orthodox stance. A southpaw boxer guards and jabs with their right hand. Some famous boxers who use southpaw are Marvelous Marvin Hagler,   Victor Ortiz, Sultan Ibragimov, Naseem Hamed, Joe Calzaghe, Manny Pacquiao, and Lucian Bute. Francisco Palacios, Andre Ward, and Terence Crawford normally fight as orthodox, but occasionally switch to a southpaw stance to confuse their opponents. Hagler was the opposite, normally fighting southpaw but able to switch to orthodox.

The Ki-87 was developed in response to American B-29 Superfortress raids on the Home Islands. It followed up on earlier research by Nakajima and the Technical Division of Imperial Army Headquarters into boosting a large radial engine with an exhaust-driven turbo-supercharger, which had begun in 1942, well before the B-29 raids began. The efforts of the Technical Division of Imperial Army Headquarters eventually culminated into the Tachikawa Ki-94-I, while the Ki-87 was developed as a fall-back project, using less stringent requirements. Nakajima started in July 1943 with the construction of three prototypes, to be completed between November 1944 and January 1945, and seven pre-production aircraft, to be delivered by April 1945. The Technical Division of Imperial Army Headquarters made itself felt during the development of the Ki-87 prototype when they insisted upon placing the turbo-supercharger in the rear-fuselage, and from the sixth prototype the Nakajima fighter was to have that arrangement. The Ki-87 had a rearward folding undercarriage to accommodate the storage of ammunition for the cannons, which were mounted in the wing.",0

138,"Liah Greenfeld is an Israeli-American Russian-Jewish interdisciplinary scholar engaged in the scientific explanation of human social reality on various levels, beginning with the individual mind and ending with the level of civilization. She has been called ""the most iconoclastic""  of contemporary sociologists and her approach represents the major alternative to the mainstream approaches in social science. Throughout her analyses, she emphasizes the empirical foundation of claims that she makes about human thought and action, underlining the importance of logical consistency between different sources of evidence as well as between the many interrelated hypotheses that come together to help us explain complex human phenomena. Because our thought and action are rarely limited to one, conveniently isolated sphere of human existence but rather occur within the context of more than one area of our reality at the same time (e.g. the political, the religious, the economic, the artistic, etc.) Greenfeld highlights the fact that an empirical study of humanity must necessarily be interdisciplinary. Best known for her trilogy on nationalism -- Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity (Harvard University Press, 1992), The Spirit of Capitalism: Nationalism and Economic Growth (Harvard University Press, 2001) and Mind, Modernity, Madness: The Impact of Culture on Human Experience (Harvard University Press, 2013), Greenfeld has studied and written about the entire range of modern social reality, including art, literature, science, religion, love, mental illness, ideological politics, economic competition, and so on.",0
216,"HaeIII is one of many restriction enzymes (endonucleases) a type of prokaryotic DNA that protects organisms from unknown, foreign DNA. It is a restriction enzyme used in molecular biology laboratories. It was the third endonuclease to be isolated from the Haemophilus aegyptius bacteria. The enzyme's recognition site—the place where it cuts DNA molecules—is the GGCC nucleotide sequence which means it cleaves DNA at the site 5′-GG/CC-3. The recognition site is usually around 4-8 bps.This enzyme's gene has been sequenced and cloned. This is done to make DNA fragments in blunt ends. HaeIII is not effective for single stranded DNA cleavage. Properties
HaeIII has a molecular weight of 37126. After a 2-10-fold of HaeIII takes place, there is overdigestion of a DNA substrate. This results in 100% being cut, more than 50% of fragments being ligated, and more than 95% being recut. Heat inactivation comes at about 80 °C for 20 minutes.

It is common on shallow coral reefs across the Indo-West Pacific, from Pakistan to New Guinea. Reaching up to  in length, the coral catshark has an extremely slender body, a short head and tail, and two dorsal fins that are angled backwards. It can be identified by the numerous black and white spots on its back, sides, and fins, which often merge to form horizontal bars. Furthermore, adult males have distinctively long and thin claspers. Reclusive and inactive during the day, at dusk and at night, the coral catshark actively forages for small, bottom-living invertebrates and bony fishes. Its slender form allows it to access tight spaces on the reef. It is oviparous; females lay purse-shaped egg capsules two at a time on the bottom, and the young hatch after 4–6 months. This small, harmless shark adapts well to captivity and has reproduced in the aquarium; it is regarded as one of the most suitable shark species for private aquarists. The coral catshark is a minor bycatch of reef fisheries, with minimal commercial value. Increasing fishing activity and extensive habitat degradation occur within its range, leading to concern over its population and its assessment as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",0

The model is simple in that it does not consider the actual merging process between vehicles as the two branch roadways come together. The only information required to calculate the flows leaving the two branch roadways are the capacities of the two branch roadways and the exiting capacity, the demands into the system, and a value describing how the two input flows interact. This latter input term is called the split priority, or merge ratio, and is defined as the proportion of the two input flows when both are operating in congested conditions. The history of the merge model has its origins in Gordon Newell's description of the merging process, but Daganzo's cell transmission model lays out a diagram for a highway merge, and describes the application of the theory.",0

433,"An excited utterance, in the law of evidence, is a statement made by a person in response to a startling or shocking event or condition. It is an unplanned reaction to a ""startling event"".  It is an exception to the hearsay rule.  The statement must be spontaneously made by the person (the declarant) while still under the stress of excitement from the event or condition.  The subject matter and content of the statement must ""relate to"" event or condition.  The statement could be a description or explanation (as required for present sense impression), or an opinion or inference.  Examples include: ""Look out! We're going to crash!"" or ""I think he's crazy.  He's shooting at us!""  The basis for this hearsay exception is the belief that a statement made under the stress is likely to be trustworthy and unlikely to be a premeditated falsehood.  Compared to present sense impression, excited utterance is broader in scope for permitting a longer time lapse between event and statement, and a wider range of content in the statement. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, an excited utterance is a hearsay exception, and is admissible to prove the truth of the statement itself (e.g., in the case of the first quotation above, to prove that the vehicle the declarant was riding in was, in fact, about to crash). To prove the truth of the statement means to persuade the finder of fact to believe the affirmative sense of the statement. ""Truth"" here does not mean truth from the subjective point of view of the declarant or from the objective point of view of a reasonably prudent person. It simply refers to the affirmative assertion of the statement.",0

1155," difference between the total external force acting on an object and its inertial or gravitational mass. The net force is a vector quantity that points in the direction of the change in velocity of the object. It can be calculated using the formula: Fnet = ma - mv^2/2m, where Fnet is the net force, m is the mass of the object, and v is its velocity at the beginning and end of the experiment. The net force is a measure of the amount of work that needs to be done on an object in order for it to change its velocity. For example, if a car has a speed of 60 km/h and a weight of 1500 kg, then the net force acting on the car would be: Fnet = ma - v^2/2m = (400 N)(9.8 m/s^2) - (1500 kg)(60 km/h)^2/2",1

The resolutions requested President James K. Polk to provide Congress with the exact location (the ""spot"") upon which blood was spilled on American soil, as Polk had claimed in 1846 when asking Congress to declare war on Mexico. So persistent was Lincoln in pushing his ""spot resolutions"" that some began referring to him as ""spotty Lincoln."" Lincoln's resolutions were a direct challenge to the validity of the president's words, and representative of an ongoing political power struggle between Whigs and Democrats. Eight resolutions sought specific information. The first: ""whether the spot on which the blood of our citizens was shed, as in his messages declared, was or was not within the territory of Spain, at least after the treaty of 1819, until the Mexican revolution."" The second: ""whether that spot is or is not within the territory which was wrested from Spain by the revolutionary Government of Mexico."" The other six resolutions extended the analysis to determine whether the territory on which the casualties occurred was ever under the government or laws of Texas or of the United States. The House of Representatives never acted on Lincoln's resolutions, but they demonstrated the Whig reluctance to accept President Polk’s grounds to begin the war.",0
1568," model is a method for analyzing and optimizing traffic flow in intersections. It was developed by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the University of Michigan in the late 1960s. The model is based on the idea that traffic congestion occurs when there are too many cars trying to enter a single intersection at the same time.
 2 The Newell–Daganzo merge model takes into account several factors that contribute to traffic congestion, including the number of lanes in each direction, the signal timing, and the presence of pedestrians or other hazards in the intersection. It also considers the behavior of drivers, such as their tendency to accelerate or decelerate quickly, which can lead to backups.
 3 The model is based on the idea that a smooth flow of traffic requires coordination between the signals at each intersection. This means that drivers should be able to see and respond to the signals in real-time, without having to wait for them",1

694,"In basketball, a technical foul (colloquially known as a ""T"" or a ""Tech"") is any infraction of the rules penalized as a foul which does not involve physical contact during the course of play between opposing players on the court, or is a foul by a non-player. The most common technical foul is for unsportsmanlike conduct. Technical fouls can be assessed against players, bench personnel, the entire team (often called a bench technical), or even the crowd. These fouls, and their penalties, are more serious than a personal foul, but not necessarily as serious as a flagrant foul (an ejectable offense in leagues below the National Basketball Association (NBA), and potentially so in the NBA). Technical fouls are handled slightly differently under international rules than under the rules used by the various competitions in the United States.  First, illegal contact between players on the court is always a personal foul under international rules, whereas in the United States, such contact is, with some exceptions, a technical foul when the game clock is not running or when the ball is dead. Second, in International Basketball Federation (FIBA) play (except for the half-court 3x3 variant, in which individual personal foul counts are not kept), players foul out after five total fouls, technical and personal combined (since 2014, one technical can be included towards the total; committing another risks immediate ejection). The latter rule is similar to that in college, high school, and middle school basketball in the United States. However, in leagues that play 48-minute games such as the NBA, and in some leagues such as the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), players are allowed six personal fouls before being disqualified, and technical fouls assessed against them do not count toward this total. However, unsportsmanlike technicals in the (W)NBA carry a fine, its severity depending on the number of technicals the player has already obtained, and players are suspended for varying amounts of time after accumulating sixteen technicals in the regular season or seven in the playoffs.",0

630,"In mathematics, an ∞-topos is, roughly, an ∞-category such that its objects behave like sheaves of spaces with some choice of Grothendieck topology; in other words, it gives an intrinsic notion of sheaves without reference to an external space. The prototypical example of an ∞-topos is the ∞-category of sheaves of spaces on some topological space. But the notion is more flexible; for example, the ∞-category of étale sheaves on some scheme is not the ∞-category of sheaves on any topological space but it is still an ∞-topos. Precisely, in Lurie's Higher Topos Theory, an ∞-topos is defined as an ∞-category X such that there is a small ∞-category C and a left exact localization functor from the ∞-category of presheaves of spaces on C to X. A theorem of Lurie states that an ∞-category is an ∞-topos if and only if it satisfies an ∞-categorical version of Giraud’s axioms in ordinary topos theory. A ""topos"" is a category behaving like the category of sheaves of sets on a topological space. In analogy, Lurie's definition and characterization theorem of an ∞-topos says that an ∞-topos is an ∞-category behaving like the category of sheaves of spaces.",0

Although the main Hatakeyama clan diminished in power and influence with the growing strength of the Ashikaga clan under the Muromachi shogunate, the Hatakeyama in Noto ruled their area as a semi-independent fief. Hatakeyama Yoshifusa (1491-1545) expanded Nanao Castle into a huge fortress.

Boyd's art criticism is lucid, well-constructed and refreshing, possessing the unusual quality of making painters legible and interesting on the page... Perhaps his professionalism as a writer combines with his abiding interest in art to give Boyd the rare skill of translating visual idiom into intelligent prose. Unfortunately, many pieces in the later sections of Bamboo fail to rise to this standard"". Urquhart's conclusion is that Bamboo ""is solid stuff, and occasionally inspiring, but too big"".

52,"In computing, the Windows Driver Model  (WDM) also known at one point as the Win32 Driver Model is a framework for device drivers that was introduced with Windows 98 and Windows 2000 to replace VxD, which was used on older versions of Windows such as Windows 95 and Windows 3.1, as well as the Windows NT Driver Model. Overview
WDM drivers are layered in a stack and communicate with each other via I/O request packets (IRPs). The Microsoft Windows Driver Model unified driver models for the Windows 9x and Windows NT product lines by standardizing requirements and reducing the amount of code that needed to be written. WDM drivers will not run on operating systems earlier than Windows 98 or Windows 2000, such as Windows 95 (before the OSR2 update that sideloads the WDM model), Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 3.1. By conforming to WDM, drivers can be binary compatible and source-compatible across Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, Windows Me, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Vista (for backwards compatibility) on x86-based computers. WDM drivers are designed to be forward-compatible so that a WDM driver can run on a version of Windows newer than what the driver was initially written for, but doing that would mean that the driver cannot take advantage of any new features introduced with the new version. WDM is generally not backward-compatible, that is, a WDM driver is not guaranteed to run on any older version of Windows.  For example, Windows XP can use a driver written for Windows 2000 but will not make use of any of the new WDM features that were introduced in Windows XP. However, a driver written for Windows XP may or may not load on Windows 2000.",0
314,"The family Caenolestidae contains the seven surviving species of shrew opossum: small, shrew-like marsupials that are confined to the Andes mountains of South America. The order is thought to have diverged from the ancestral marsupial line very early. They were once included in the superorder but it is now known that Ameridelphia is paraphyletic, having given rise to Australidelphia, and thus could be considered an evolutionary grade. Genetic studies indicate that they are the second most basal order of marsupials, after the didelphimorphs. As recently as 20 million years ago, at least seven genera were in South America. Today, just three genera remain. They live in inaccessible forest and grassland regions of the High Andes. Shrews were entirely absent from South America until the Great American Interchange three million years ago, and are currently present only in the northwestern part of the continent. Traditionally, it was thought that shrew opossums lost ground to these and other placental invaders that fill the same ecological niches. Evidence suggests, however, that both groups not only overlap, but do not seem to be in direct competition, and the marsupials' larger size seems to imply that they prey on shrews and rodents. Several opossums, such as Monodelphis, also occupy small insectivore niches.",0

He then took over Antioch, and launched a failed attack on the Hamdanid capital, Aleppo in early 966. He took the lower city and besieged the citadel for over three months, but was killed and his men fled back to Antioch. Life 
Rashiq is first mentioned in late 961, as commanding a Tarsian army sent to confront the invasion of the Byzantines under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, who were besieging Ayn Zarba. Rashiq tried to break the siege, but was defeated with heavy loss: according to Yahya of Antioch, 5,000 Tarsians fell and 4,000 were taken prisoner, while Rashiq managed to flee. As a result, Ayn Zarba surrendered (December 961/January 962). Then the governor of Tarsus, Ibn az-Zayyat, who had tried to break free from Hamdanid control, confronted the Byzantines but was also defeated. The Tarsians turned once more to Sayf al-Dawla for protection from the Byzantines, and Ibn az-Zayyat committed suicide, whereupon Sayf al-Dawla appointed Rashiq as his successor.",0
616,"Xerocomellus is a genus of fungi in the family Boletaceae. The genus, as it was described in 2008, contained 12 species.  However X. rubellus and X. engelii  were transferred to the new genus Hortiboletus and X. armeniacus was transferred to the new genus Rheubarbariboletus in 2015. Molecular analysis supports the distinction of Xerocomellus species from Boletus and Xerocomus, within which these species were formerly contained.  Xerocomellus in fact is only distantly related to Xerocomus and is most closely related to Tylopilus, Boletus sensu stricto, Porphyrellus, Strobilomyces, and Xanthoconium. Taxonomy
Members of the genus had been classified either in the genus Boletus or Xerocomus until Czech mycologist Josef Šutara examined a number of species and concluded that there was a defined group containing X. chrysenteron, X. armeniacus and relatives that are distinct morphologically from the group containing Xerocomus subtomentosus and related species. He deferred fully delimiting the genus until genetic work confirmed their distinctness. Previously, Manfred Binder had coined the term Paraxerocomus for the group but this was not officially published.",0

The Redpsotted Hawkfish was first formally described as Pseudocirrhites pinos in 1927 by the Bermudan naturalist Louis L. Mowbray with the type locality given as Point Francis on the Isle of Pines in Cuba. In 1829 the French zoologist Georges Cuvier described a species he called Cirrhites fasciatus, giving it a type locality of Puducherry in India. This is now considered to be an error, since the fish described most likely came from the Atlantic Ocean. When Theodore Nicholas Gill described the genus Amblycirrhitus in 1861 he used Cuvier's C. fasciatus as its type species. However, Cuvier's name was preoccupied by Edward Turner Bennett's 1828 usage of the name for a related species, A. pinos is the type species of Amblycirrhitus under Cuvier's invalid name. Mowbray's specific name pinos refers to the Isle of Pines.",0

396,"Silvanus was a Roman soldier and probably praetorian prefect during the third century who came briefly to the notice of history in the reign of Valerian and his co-Emperor Gallienus. He is generally assumed to have been the commander of the praetorians under Gallienus. However, the sources only tell us that he was made the guardian of the Caesar Saloninus by Saloninus's father, the Emperor Gallienus. This seems likely to mean that he exercised a guiding influence over his young protégé as he represented the Imperial Dynasty in the government of the Gallic provinces. In this respect Silvanus may be compared with Ingenuus who seems to have exercised a similar function, in loco parentis, in the command of the Danubian provinces by Saloninus's elder brother, the Caesar Valeriannus, earlier in the 250s. He would not have been given this office had he not been a seasoned soldier and administrator, but this does not mean that he was Gallienus's Praetorian Prefect.",0

It formed in the southern Caribbean on October 9 and strengthened as it moved northwestward, becoming a hurricane on October 12. After crossing the western tip of Cuba, it peaked in intensity on October 16, corresponding to Category 4 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. That same day, the hurricane moved in a counterclockwise loop and hit Cuba again. It then tracked toward Florida, landing near Cape Romano. After moving through the state, it hugged the coast of the Southeastern United States on its way out to sea. Due to its unusual loop, initial reports suggested it was two separate storms that developed and hit land in rapid succession. Its track was subject to much debate at the time; eventually, it was identified as a single storm. Analysis of the event gave a greater understanding of weather systems that took similar paths.",0

573,"Haloa or Alo (Ἁλῶα)  was an Attic festival, celebrated principally at Eleusis, in honour of Demeter (Δήμητρα, η Αλωαίη), protector of the fruits of the earth, of Dionysus, god of the grape and of wine, and Poseidon (Ποσειδώνας ο Φυτάλμιος), god of the seashore vegetation. In Greek, the word hálōs (ἅλως) from which Haloa derives means “threshing-floor” or “garden.” While the general consensus is that it was a festival related to threshing—the process of loosening the edible part of cereal grain after harvest—some scholars disagree and argue that it was instead a gardening festival. Haloa focuses mainly on the “first fruits” of the harvest, partly as a grateful acknowledgement for the benefits the husbandmen received, partly as prayer that the next harvest would be plentiful. The festival was also called Thalysia or Syncomesteria. The festival 
Haloa took place every year, during the month Poseideon (Ποσειδέωνας), after the first harvest was over. The festival took place around the threshing floor (αλώνια) at the same time throughout Attica. All women were expected to attend this event, but men were almost always excluded. Men had a legal and moral expectation to pay for their wives’ expenses in these festivities.
The strange timing of the harvest festival—mid-winter—is significant as well. The Greeks regarded the festival as sacred to not only Demeter but also to Dionysus. With the inclusion of Dionysus in the festival worship, the date shifted towards the winter as “he possessed himself of the festivals of Demeter, took over her threshing-floor and compelled the anomaly of a winter threshing festival.” In many ways, the festival was just as connected, if not more so, with Dionysus than with Demeter. Thus, we see the power and influence of the incoming god and of the importance of wine to Greek cult activity. Practically, Greeks were able to coax out a harvest just early enough to revel with Dionysus.",0

The off-off-Broadway movement began in 1958 as part of an anti-commercial and experimental or avant-garde movement of drama and theatre. Over time, some off-off-Broadway productions have moved away from the movement's early experimental spirit. History 
The off-off-Broadway movement began in 1958 as a ""complete rejection of commercial theatre"".  Michael Smith gives credit for the term's coinage to Jerry Tallmer in 1960. Among the first venues for what would soon be called ""off-off-Broadway"" theatre were coffeehouses in Greenwich Village, particularly the Caffe Cino at 31 Cornelia Street, operated by the eccentric Joe Cino, who early on took a liking to actors and playwrights and agreed to let them stage plays there without bothering to read the plays first, or to even find out much about the content. This DIY aesthetic also led to creative acts of object repurposing by playwrights and directors, who cobbled together sets from materials scavenged from local streets. Also integral to the rise of off-off-Broadway were Ellen Stewart at La MaMa, and Al Carmines at Judson Poets Theatre, located at Judson Memorial Church. Other theaters of note that presented many plays were Theatre Genesis, New York Theatre Ensemble, The Old Reliable, The Dove Company, The Playwrights Workshop, and Workshop of the Players Art.",0

520,"Raison Oblige Theory offers an alternate explanation of exhibited behaviors widely accepted to be caused by the motive of self-verification (SVT)(William Swann, 1983). The theory addresses instances of apparent self-view confirmation strivings and details an economical description of why these behaviors occur. Focusing on the importance of the self-view and rational thought, (see self-esteem; self concept; self knowledge) Raison oblige theory (ROT) accounts for the evidence supporting SVT including the well documented seemingly mal-adaptive self verifying behaviors.  SVT states that a person is actively motivated to confirm their existing self view regardless of the objective accuracy or valence of that view. In other words, a person wants to confirm their currently held self views above and beyond wanting this information to be accurate or positive. (see self verification for details).
 ROT challenges the existence of a motive and offers a plausible explanation which can account for all instances of self-verifying behaviors.
 The fundamentals of ROT are that people are obliged by reason to accept information that is congruent with their currently held self views and reject information that is not. The theory challenges a self-verification motive, stating that people do not want to self-verify, they simply convey, through behaviour, cognitions that accurately and honestly reflect their own self views.",0

He captured Vanthali and later Junagadh was besieged. Meliga left to a fort on Girnar hill which was inaccessible to the forces. So the forces left and placed two officers in Junagadh to collect tribute. Meliga died and was succeeded by his son Jayasimha II in 1416 CE. Reign
Meliga succeeded his elder brother Mandalika II in 1400 CE. His father Mokalasimha had to move the capital from Junagadh to Vanthali due to order from the Governor of Gujarat Zafar Khan on behalf of Delhi Sultan Firuz Shah Tughluq who placed a thanadar. It seems that Meliga had played no role when Zafar Khan attacked Somnath temple in 1402 CE which was under repair. Meliga expelled the thanadar from Junagadh and again made it his capital. According to the Mandalika Kavya, he had sheltered a Jhala chieftain (probably Satarsal) fleeing from Gujarat Sultan Ahmad Shah I. Mirat-i-Sikandari tells that, in 1413-14 CE, Ahmad Shah marched against Junagadh. On this occasion, Melinga fought a pitched battle with Ahmad Shah at Vanthali but was defeated and fled to Junagadh. Vanthali was taken by Ahmad Shah who then marched to Junagadh and took the lower fortress (the Uparkot but the Raja escaped by fleeing to the upper fortress of Girnar.

83,"Constant-voltage speaker systems refer to networks of loudspeakers which are connected to an audio amplifier using step-up and step-down transformers to simplify impedance calculations and to minimize power loss over the speaker cables. They are more appropriately called high-voltage audio distribution systems. The voltage is constant only in the sense that at full power, the voltage in the system does not depend on the number of speakers driven (as long the amplifier's maximum power is not exceeded). Constant-voltage speaker systems are also commonly referred to as 25-, 70-, 70.7-, or 100-volt speaker systems; distributed speaker systems; or high-impedance speaker systems.  In Canada and the US, they are most commonly referred to as 70-volt speakers. In Europe, the 100 V system is the most widespread, with amplifier and speaker products being simply labeled with 100 V. Operation
Constant-voltage speaker systems are analogous to electrical power transmission methods employed by electric utility companies to transmit electric power over long distances. Typically, an electric utility will step up the voltage of the power transmitted, which correspondingly reduces the current, hence reducing the power loss during transmission. The voltage is stepped down at the destination. Similarly, in a constant-voltage speaker system, the amplifier uses a transformer to step up the voltage of the audio signal to reduce power loss over the speaker cable, allowing more power to be transmitted over a given wire diameter. Each speaker in the system has a step-down transformer to reduce the voltage to a usable level.",0

With an angel—a creature of fantasy unlike a religious angel—as protagonist and taking place in contemporary England, the book could be classified as contemporary fantasy, although the genre was not recognised in Wells's time.  The Wonderful Visit also has strong satirical themes, gently mocking customs and institutions of Victorian England as well as idealistic rebellion itself. Plot summary
The Wonderful Visit tells how an angel spends a little more than a week in southern England. He is at first mistaken for a bird because of his dazzling polychromatic plumage, for he is ""neither the Angel of religious feeling nor the Angel of popular belief,"" but rather ""the Angel of Italian art."" As a result, he is hunted and shot in the wing by an amateur ornithologist, the Rev. K. Hilyer, the vicar of Siddermoton, and then taken in and cared for at the vicarage. The creature comes from ""the Land of Dreams"" (also the angel's term for our world), and while ""charmingly affable,"" is ""quite ignorant of the most elementary facts of civilisation."" During his brief visit he grows increasingly dismayed by what he learns about the world in general and about life in Victorian England in particular. As he grows increasingly critical of local mores, he is eventually denounced as ""a Socialist.""",0
