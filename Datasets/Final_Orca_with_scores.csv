1," as the Bloody Mary crater, is a large depression located in the southern part of the Moon's surface. It was formed during a lunar impact event that occurred around 3.8 billion years ago, when a large object struck the Moon and caused a massive explosion that sent debris flying into space. The crater is about 120 kilometers (75 miles) wide and has a complex shape due to the interaction of the ejecta from the impact with the lunar surface. The name ""Bloody Creek"" comes from the fact that the crater was first observed by American astronomer Asaph Hall in 1834, who noticed that its appearance resembled a creek bed on Earth. Since then, it has been studied and imaged extensively by spacecraft such as Apollo missions, and is considered an important geological feature of the Moon's surface.",1.0,1.3284671532846715,5.809523809523809,27.4,0.3722627737226277,0.022796352583586626,-53.70499999999997,55.53,61.142857142857146,16.44535714285714,145.9533607681756,0.915063186564459,0.01731540377898673,0.9416666666666667,0.9415977961432506,0.014704256495301271,0.1819869620333016,0.11071428571428571

45,"A bench shirt is a stiff supportive shirt, used to improve performance in the bench press, most often in powerlifting competitions. Bench shirts are usually made of polyester, denim, or canvas and come in single- or multi-ply thicknesses. The extremely tight fit of a bench shirt supports the weightlifter's shoulders and deltoid muscles. Different powerlifting federations have different rules governing allowed equipment—for example, the only supportive equipment allowed by the 100% Raw Powerlifting Federation for bench press is a leather belt, whereas the International Powerlifting Federation stipulates that support shirts must be ""of one ply stretch material"". As the same lifter's performance may vary significantly depending on the presence and design of a bench shirt (for example, Scot Mendelson, whose shirted bench press record is 1030 lbs, while his unshirted best is 715 lbs), records across different federations or categories may not be directly comparable.

It was originally named Castle's Wood's, as the land in the immediate area had once belonged to Jacob Castle, a frontiersman in the likes of Daniel Boone. Castle purchased the land from the Shawnee Indians, for very little in trade.  It is reported that the purchase was made with the Shawnee Indians for a ""hound dog, a knife, and a shot of whiskey. As a ""Long Hunter"", he spent long periods of time in the wilderness on hunting expeditions.  There he befriended the Indians that inhabited the land in the Castlewood area.  He married a Shawnee woman by the name of Gliding Swan and they produced many children. It has been said that Castle himself showed Daniel Boone the Cumberland Gap and areas west, which led to Boone's expedition and settlement of said lands.  Many descendants of Castle reside in Russell County, Virginia and the surrounding area.  Castle's father, Peter Cassell was a German emigrant to Pennsylvania who was influential in the Dutch movement to America.

48,"Quda'a (/ALA-LC: Quḍāʿa) were a group of Arab tribes with unclear genealogical origins, with traditional Arab genealogists ascribing their descent to Ma'add, Himyar or both. Origins
The origins of the Quda'a are obscure, with the claims of medieval Arab genealogists being contradictory. Some claimed that Quda'a, the tribe's progenitor, was a son of Ma'add, thus making the tribe northern Arabians, or a descendant of Himyar (south Arabians), basing their claims on traditions and quotes attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Among these alleged utterances of Muhammad were that Ma'add's kunya was Abū Quḍāʿa (""Father of Quda'a"") or that he explicitly stated Quda'a was a descendant of Himyar. Some medieval traditions harmonized these seemingly contradictory claims by holding that Quda'a's mother was the wife of Malik ibn 'Amr ibn Murra ibn Malik ibn Himyar, and that she later wed Ma'add, bringing Quda'a with her; thus Quda'a became known as a son of Ma'add, albeit not a biological one. This tradition is espoused by Ibn Abd Rabbih, who further notes that ""Quda'a"" was an epithet meaning ""leopard"" and the progenitor's actual name was 'Amr. Other traditions hold that at the dawn of the Umayyad era, the tribes of Quda'an embraced their descent from Ma'add, but under political pressure and bribes from the Umayyad caliph Mu'awiyah, switched their traditional line of descent to Himyar; by doing so, they embraced a Southern Arabian identity in the historical division of Arab tribes along southern and northern lines.",0.0,1.5578512396694215,6.1847133757961785,34.57142857142857,0.34297520661157027,0.042602633617350893,-55.950047528517075,53.73150190114069,57.92319391634981,17.483538783269964,144.86258294900895,0.8735462843178446,0.02269386577469278,0.9333333333333335,0.9263721552878192,0.014541549357095174,0.19039302048215734,0.10140562248995985

62,"Uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine or UDP-GlcNAc is a nucleotide sugar and a coenzyme in metabolism. It is used by glycosyltransferases to transfer N-acetylglucosamine residues to substrates. D-Glucosamine is made naturally in the form of glucosamine-6-phosphate, and is the biochemical precursor of all nitrogen-containing sugars. To be specific, glucosamine-6-phosphate is synthesized from fructose 6-phosphate and glutamine as the first step of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway.  The end-product of this pathway is UDP-GlcNAc, which is then used for making glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and glycolipids. UDP-GlcNAc is extensively involved in intracellular signaling as a substrate for O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferases (OGTs) to install the O-GlcNAc post-translational modification in a wide range of species. It is also involved in nuclear pore formation and nuclear signalling. OGTs and OG-ases play an important role in the structure of the cytoskeleton. In mammals, there is enrichment of OGT transcripts in the pancreas beta-cells, and  UDP-GlcNAc is thought to be part of the glucose sensing mechanism. There is also evidence that it plays a part in insulin sensitivity in other cells. In plants, it is involved in the control of gibberellin production.",0.0,1.7403314917127073,8.596153846153847,16.454545454545453,0.4198895027624309,0.01725703905540418,-132.9927071823204,76.77458563535912,81.6817679558011,19.68034309392265,186.1970025335002,0.895251131657238,0.020149837099600262,0.9222222222222224,0.9081836327345314,0.0187231430325353,0.18400613113735903,0.14427860696517414
63,"The green jack (Caranx caballus), also known as the horse jack, is an abundant species of coastal marine fish in the jack family Carangidae. The species is distributed in the eastern Pacific Ocean along the American coastline from Santa Cruz Island off California in the north to Peru in the south, as well as a number of islands including the Galapagos and recently, Hawaii. The green jack is distinguished from other similar carangid species by a number of features including gill raker and lateral line scale counts, and the presence of an adipose eyelid. It is a moderately large species, growing to at least 55 cm in length and 2.81 kg, although unconfirmed reports suggest a much larger maximum size. It lives in a wide range of continental shelf environments including estuaries, bays, reefs and offshore seamounts, living both pelagically and demersally. The green jack is a predatory species, preying on  a variety of fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, as well as zooplankton. Most fish are sexually mature by the time they attain 38 cm, with spawning occurring between May and October. The species is of high importance to fisheries throughout its range, caught by pelagic trawls, a variety of netting methods and hook and line. The green jack is also of interest to anglers, taken by bait and lures, although is considered to only be fair in eating quality. Taxonomy and naming

73,"Mawewe, or Maueva, was king of the Gaza Empire and son of king Soshangane Nxumalo. Mawewe was born to a Swati woman whom King Soshangane had married. Mawewe felt that since he was older than his half brother, Mzila of a Tsonga mother, that he should be king of Gaza. After the death of King Soshangane, Mawewe began to attack his brothers, including Mzila. Mzila fled and made his way to the Transvaal in 1859 to seek help to fight his brother.  Mawewe hated the Portuguese and wanted them out of Gaza territory. Mostly Vatsonga youths were used in his army, as his father King Soshangane did. Mawewe's reputation was that of expansionism. Most other clans and tribes were attacked or slaughtered, and people ran to Mzila. When Mzila returned, he had help from the Portuguese to fight Mawewe's army. Mzila managed to defeat his brother, despite Mawewe having a large and experienced army. Mawewe made his way to eSwatini (present day Swaziland) to seek for new beginnings. He used the surname Mkhatshwa, which most of his descendants still use today.

89,"Crimean Goths were Greuthungi-Gothic tribes who remained in the lands around the Black Sea, especially in Crimea. They were the least-impactful on the fate of Europe and the longest-lasting of the Gothic communities. Their existence is well attested through the ages though the exact period when they ceased to exist as a distinct culture is unknown; as with the Goths in general, they may have been diffused with the surrounding peoples. In the Fourth Turkish letter by Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, they are described as ""a warlike people, who to this day inhabit many villages"" though in the 5th century, Theodoric the Great failed to rouse Crimean Goths to support his war in Italy. At the time, it was customary to refer to a wide range of Germanic tribes as ""Goths"", so the exact ethnic origin of the Germanic peoples in Crimea is a subject of debate. Aside from textual reports of the existence of the Goths in Crimea, both first and second hand, from as early as 850, numerous archaeological examples also exist, including the ruins of the former capital city of the Crimean Goths: Doros, or Mangup as it is now known.

95,"Neonatal hypoglycemia occurs when the neonate's blood glucose level is less than the newborn's body requirements for factors such as cellular energy and metabolism. There is inconsistency internationally for diagnostic thresholds. In the US, hypoglycemia is when the blood glucose level is below 30 mg/dl within the first 24 hours of life and below 45 mg/dl thereafter. In the UK, however, lower and more variable thresholds are used (<18 mg/dl at any time OR baby with abnormal clinical signs and a single value <45 mg/dl OR baby at risk of impaired metabolic adaptation but without abnormal clinical signs and a measurement <36 mg/dl and remaining <36 mg/dl at next measurement). The neonate's gestational age, birth weight, metabolic needs, and wellness state of the newborn has a substantial impact on the neonates blood glucose level. There are known risk factors that can be both maternal and neonatal. This is a treatable condition. Its treatment depends on the cause of the hypoglycemia. Though it is treatable, it can be fatal if gone undetected.  Hypoglycemia is the most common metabolic problem in newborns.

As with other Mari subgroups they are Volga Finns. Their native language is Northwestern Mari, one of the four surviving members of the Mari branch of the Uralic language family. History 
The origin of the Northwestern Maris belongs to the larger history of the Mari people. Most scientists, based on linguistic and archaeological data, associated them with being descendants of the north-western part of the Iron Age Gorodets culture. It was localized between the middle Volga's right tributaries Oka and Sura. In the 6th century AD Gorodets population moved to the north bank of Volga up to Vetluga and Bolshaya Kokshaga rivers. There they was greatly influenced by the Ananyino culture. The differences between Northwestern and other groups of Mari appeared in the 9th-10th centuries. In the 10th-13th centuries some related upper Volga Dyakovo tribes joined to Northwestern Maris and were assimilated by them.

Despite the short duration of the depressive episodes, such episodes are severe, and suicidal ideation and impaired function is rather common. The majority of patients with RBD also report symptoms of anxiety and increased irritability. Hypersomnia is also rather frequent. About 1/2 of patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria for RBD may have additional short episodes of brief hypomania which is a severity marker of RBD.

118,"Professional Identification is a type of social identification and is the sense of oneness individuals have with a profession (e.g. law, medicine) and the degree to which individuals define themselves as profession members. Professional identity consists of the individual's alignment of roles, responsibilities, values, and ethical standards to be consistent with practices accepted by their specific profession. Sources of professional identification 
Researchers have found that a desire for quality (rather than profits) is associated with professional identification.  Organizations tend to be concerned with efficiency and profitability, whereas professions care mainly about providing the highest-quality service (as defined by the professions), almost regardless of cost or revenue considerations (Freidson, 2001). Administrators are usually seen as promoting profitability at the expense of profession-defined quality (Freidson, 2001). In one notable study, practicing physicians viewed administrators with medical degrees (e.g., the M.D.) as “outsiders” to the medical profession because of what the physicians believed to be the administrators’ undue emphasis on organizational goals (Hoff, 1999: 336). Practicing physicians viewed administrators with MDs more negatively than those without MDs because the former were thought to have “betrayed” the medical profession by assuming administrative roles (Hoff, 1999: 344).",0.0,1.765625,7.832,21.333333333333332,0.3802083333333333,0.022598870056497175,-59.24520408163262,45.86877551020409,51.44489795918368,17.197912244897957,108.58725761772853,0.9059592877280344,0.017922675973781825,0.9444444444444446,0.9613636363636376,0.01091617933723197,0.20911603563827946,0.13578680203045684

Cirquent calculus is a complete system of logic that includes all of the standard logical connectives such as AND, OR, NOT, and implication. It also allows for the introduction of new connectives based on graphical structures.

The glucose and fructose are linked by an alpha-1,6-glycosidic bond (chemical name: 6-0-α-D-glucopyranosyl-D-fructose). Isomaltulose is present in honey and sugarcane extracts. It tastes similar to sucrose (table sugar) with half the sweetness. Isomaltulose, also known by the trade name Palatinose, is manufactured by enzymatic rearrangement (isomerization) of sucrose from beet sugar. The enzyme and its source were discovered in Germany in 1950, and since then its physiological role and physical properties have been studied extensively. Isomaltulose  has been used as an alternative to sugar in foods in Japan since 1985, in the EU since 2005, in the US since 2006, and in Australia and New Zealand since 2007, besides other countries worldwide. Analytical methods for characterization and assay of commercial isomaltulose are laid down, for example, in the Food Chemicals Codex.

Gyftopoulos received an undergraduate degree in mechanical and electrical engineering in 1953 from the National Technical University of Athens, and a Doctor of Science degree in electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1958. At MIT, he initially focused on nuclear reactor safety and control. After meeting professors George N. Hatsopoulos and Joseph H. Keenan, his interests moved towards thermodynamics, in an attempt to give a consistent and rigorous exposition, free of the logical flaws and the limitations commonly associated with this discipline: the result was a non-statistical theory, applicable to both macroscopic and microscopic systems, both in equilibrium and in non-equilibrium.

152,"The Kalo Shop was the ""leading maker"" of Arts and Crafts movement silver in Chicago.  The shop and affiliated Kalo Arts and Crafts Community House, a  practicing school and workshop noted for silver and jewelry in nearby Park Ridge, Illinois, were founded in 1900 by a group of six young women who had trained at the Art Institute of Chicago. Clara Pauline Barck Welles (1868-1965) was the group's leader and most notable member.  The other founders were: Bertha Hall, Rose Dolese, Grace Gerow, Ruth Raymond, and Bessie McNeal. The group, at first, worked in a variety of materials and media including burnt wood and leather but by the time the Chicago shop was opened in 1914, it was focused on silver, copper, and jewelry, though it rapidly transitioned to hand wrought silver flatware and hollowware, and gold and silver jewelry.  In 1959, Barck Wells transferred the shop to four of the craftsmen; Robert Bower, Daniel Pederson, Arne Myhre, and Yngve Olsson.  Barck hired women designers almost exclusively, although the immigrant Scandinavian craftsmen were male.  At its peak, Kalo employed 25 silversmiths.  After Barck's retirement, the firm continued to produce the pieces designed under her leadership until 1970, when it closed, due to the difficulty of finding young people willing to apprentice as silversmiths. In the summer 1992 issue of American Silversmith, Bower, the last, surviving Kalo silversmith, explained to an interviewer that,  ""We ran out of silversmiths. In the last year we lost our three top silversmiths; men who could not be replaced.

171,"In common usage, the mass of an object is often referred to as its weight, though these are in fact different concepts and quantities. In scientific contexts, mass is the amount of ""matter"" in an object (though ""matter"" may be difficult to define), whereas weight is the force exerted on an object by gravity. In other words, an object with a mass of 1.0 kilogram weighs approximately 9.81 newtons on the surface of the Earth, which is its mass multiplied by the gravitational field strength. The object's weight is less on Mars, where gravity is weaker, and more on Saturn, and very small in space when far from any significant source of gravity, but it always has the same mass. Objects on the surface of the Earth have weight, although sometimes the weight is difficult to measure. An example is a small object floating in water, which does not appear to have weight since it is buoyed by the water; but it is found to have its usual weight when it is added to water in a container which is entirely supported by and weighed on a scale. Thus, the ""weightless object"" floating in water actually transfers its weight to the bottom of the container (where the pressure increases). Similarly, a balloon has mass but may appear to have no weight or even negative weight, due to buoyancy in air. However the weight of the balloon and the gas inside it has merely been transferred to a large area of the Earth's surface, making the weight difficult to measure. The weight of a flying airplane is similarly distributed to the ground, but does not disappear. If the airplane is in level flight, the same weight-force is distributed to the surface of the Earth as when the plane was on the runway, but spread over a larger area.",0.0,1.244299674267101,6.074074074074074,27.90909090909091,0.4820846905537459,0.028975265017667843,-219.00041800643083,121.06655948553055,128.12990353697748,23.98695530546624,206.2621354072722,0.8552418391102578,0.025277110073465982,0.9066666666666668,0.9092150170648491,0.020693619467330907,0.1736303611737686,0.11370967741935484

186,"The Château de Kaysersberg (also: Schlossberg) is a ruined castle in the commune of Kaysersberg in the Haut-Rhin département  of France. History
The castle was built for Albin Woelflin, imperial bailiff for Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, around 1220. The site was acquired in 1227 by the lords of Horbourg and Ribeaupierre. It had an important strategic role as it allowed the Empire to close off one of the routes across the Vosges Mountains towards Lorraine. The circular keep is the oldest part of the castle and one of the first of this type in the upper Rhine valley. It was designed at the same time as the keep at the Château de Pflixbourg. The first curtain wall, which included the keep, was replaced after 1261 by a wall enclosing the keep, according to a contemporary plan, which allowed an uninterrupted circuit of the walls and strengthened defences on the side likely to be attacked. 
In the 14th century, the castle was the residence of the imperial provost or bailiff. Following a fire, the enceinte was raised to 4 m. In the second half of the 15th century, the castle defences were modernised in response to developments in artillery and firearms; the crenels were closed with wooden shutters, the merlons were equipped with firing slits and the round walk was completely covered. In this period, the castle was merely a sub-bailliage and personnel were heavily reduced. During the German Peasants' War (1524/5), the castle was besieged.

It involves how people understand and define themselves based on their professional roles, responsibilities, achievements, and experiences. Professional identification can be influenced by various factors such as job satisfaction, career goals, personal values, and cultural norms. The concept of professional identification has been studied by several researchers who have found that it plays a significant role in shaping individuals' behavior, attitudes, and outcomes in the workplace. For example, research has shown that professionals with strong professional identification tend to be more committed, engaged, and productive in their work, while those without strong professional identification may experience higher levels of burnout and job dissatisfaction.

228,"In computer science and mathematics, a full employment theorem is a term used, often humorously, to refer to a theorem which states that no algorithm can optimally perform a particular task done by some class of professionals. The name arises because such a theorem ensures that there is endless scope to keep discovering new techniques to improve the way at least some specific task is done. For example, the full employment theorem for compiler writers states that there is no such thing as a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler, as such a proof for the compiler would have to detect non-terminating computations and reduce them to a one-instruction infinite loop. Thus, the existence of a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler would imply a solution to the halting problem, which cannot exist. This also implies that there may always be a better compiler since the proof that one has the best compiler cannot exist. Therefore, compiler writers will always be able to speculate that they have something to improve. A similar example in practical computer science is the idea of no free lunch in search and optimization, which states that no efficient general-purpose solver can exist, and hence there will always be some particular problem whose best known solution might be improved.",0.0,1.4497607655502391,6.75206611570248,29.857142857142858,0.42105263157894735,0.015625,-144.1411483253588,85.28555023923445,91.63827751196173,19.518067464114836,123.62354341704632,0.8798551614518817,0.022489202824389213,0.9333333333333335,0.9411965811965819,0.012421788737578212,0.1633147388574995,0.1365740740740741

Variants of portals include mashups and intranet ""dashboards"" for executives and managers.

Originating in units of rifle volunteers formed in Monmouthshire in 1859, the regiment served in the Second Anglo-Boer War and both World War I and World War II before losing its separate identity in 1967. Origins
Units of rifle volunteers were formed throughout Great Britain in 1859 and 1860 in response to a perceived threat of invasion by France following the Orsini affair. The raising of such units was to be authorised by lieutenants of counties in England, Wales and Scotland. The first corps in Monmouthshire was raised on 9 September 1859. By 1880 the various small corps in the county had been consolidated into three battalion-sized units, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Monmouthshire Rifle Volunteer Corps. In the following year the Childers Reforms of line infantry saw the three Monmouthshire corps becoming volunteer battalions of the regular South Wales Borderers. In 1885 they were redesignated as the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Volunteer battalions of the South Wales Borderers (the 1st Volunteer Battalion being formed at the same time from the 1st Brecknockshire Rifle Volunteers).",0.0,1.4157894736842105,6.55,23.75,0.33157894736842103,0.01310483870967742,-9.811052631578931,38.22842105263159,42.8421052631579,15.744868421052631,231.2522642192972,0.8730378447730381,0.02439700078446272,0.8722222222222223,0.8908730158730168,0.023252990103818833,0.17382816186242273,0.08160621761658031

287,"The  is an archaeological site with the ruins of a Kofun period residence located in what is now the Higashimachi neighborhood of the city of Takasaki, Gunma Prefecture in the northern Kantō region of Japan. It was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 2005, and extended in 2020.It is contemporary with the nearby Hodota Kofun Cluster which has a separate National Historic Site designation. Overview
The Kitayatsu site is located is located on a plateau at an elevation of 145 meters that spreads out at the foot of the southeastern foot of Mount Haruna. In the year 2000, the ruins of a large fortified residence belonging to a gōzoku clan ruling the surrounding area during the Kofun period was discovered. The site was fortified by two ravines forming natural moats to the east and west and two artificial moats with a width of 30 meters and depth of three meters to protect the northern and southern sides. The moats contained masonry with a breccia substrate, and it appears that the north and west moats also served for water storage. It is estimated through analysis of the volcanic ash from an eruption of Mount Asama which had accumulated in the moats to date from the latter half of the 5th century AD, or the middle of the Kofun period. The site of the residence is a square 90 meters on each side, containing buildings arranged in a ""U"" shape, forming a courtyard that was open to the south.

288,"Cheiracanthium inclusum, alternately known as the black-footed yellow sac spider or the American yellow sac spider (in order to distinguish it from its European cousin C. punctorium), was formerly classified as a true sac spider (of the family Clubionidae), and then placed in the family Miturgidae, but now belongs to family Cheiracanthiidae. It is a rather small pale yellow species that is indigenous to the Americas and can be found living in the foliage of forests and gardens but also can inhabit human homes. Despite common beliefs of necrosis, Cheiracanthium bites cause only localized swelling. C. inclusum is closely related to Cheiracanthium mildei, an introduced species native to Europe which is similar in appearance and natural history and can also be found in North American homes. Identification
Like all spiders, C. inclusum has two body segments: a cephalothorax (fused head and thorax) and an abdomen. In females, the body measures between 5 and 9 mm and in males, 4 to 8 mm. The leg span however can be up to  with the front pair of legs being longer than the other 3 pairs. Males tend to have a narrower body and a larger leg span than females. C. inclusum gets its two common names (yellow sac and black-footed spider) from its appearance. It is a pale yellow-beige colour with dark brown markings on its palps, chelicerae (jaws) and on the ends of its tarsi (feet). There is also often an orange-brown stripe running down the top-centre of its abdomen. 
C. inclusum has 8 similarly sized eyes, distributed in 2 parallel horizontal rows. However, ocular input is of minor import, due to the absence of light during the spider's nocturnal activities. The spider relies more on its palps, sensory structures just behind the chelicerae, on the cephalothorax, to sense its environment.",0.0,1.4433333333333334,6.245901639344262,21.428571428571427,0.36,0.0245520902455209,-30.194695459579137,42.39647840531562,46.64496124031008,15.117883831672204,109.21375352862233,0.8951394268219508,0.018449740739215462,0.9403508771929827,0.9352380952380969,0.010958649671472684,0.18103301134356073,0.12781350482315113

An example of a lateral consonant is the English L, as in Larry. Lateral consonants contrast with central consonants, in which the airstream flows through the center of the mouth. For the most common laterals, the tip of the tongue makes contact with the upper teeth (see dental consonant) or the upper gum (see alveolar consonant), but there are many other possible places for laterals to be made. The most common laterals are approximants and belong to the class of liquids, but lateral fricatives and affricates are also common in some parts of the world.

294,"Joseph Evans Sperry  (1854–1930) was an American architect, noted for designing buildings in Baltimore. He was born in Georgetown, South Carolina and later relocated to Baltimore, Maryland, where he partnered with James Bosley Noel Wyatt to form the architectural firm Wyatt and Sperry.  Their affiliation lasted from 1878 to 1887.  The two probably became acquainted while working in the office of Architect, E. Francis Baldwin, where he worked from 1872 until 1876.  With Wyatt, he designed a number of buildings around Baltimore before breaking off on his own.  Sperry became one of Baltimore's leading architects, designing many public buildings, including churches, hospitals, and banks.  In 1914 he was named a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects.  Sperry also designed several buildings at Johns Hopkins University and one building at West Virginia University. Sperry's most famous building is probably the Emerson ""Bromo-Seltzer"" Tower in Baltimore.  Sperry's buildings were designed in a variety of styles, but overall were eclectic.

295," author David Foster Wallace. It was published in hardcover format by Little, Brown and Company on September 3, 2014. The novel follows the story of Holden Caulfield, a teenage boy who has been expelled from his boarding school and is wandering around New York City. The book is divided into three sections, each told from the perspective of a different character: Holden himself, a college student named Desmond, and an unnamed narrator who was a classmate of Holden's in high school. 
 
The novel explores themes such as alienation, identity, and the nature of human connection through Holden's perspective. It has been praised for its exploration of complex ideas and its use of language, but it has also been criticized for its controversial content and lack of coherence. The book was a commercial success, selling over 200,000 copies in its first week of publication alone, and was later adapted into",1.0,1.3221476510067114,6.303370786516854,21.285714285714285,0.3422818791946309,0.027777777777777776,24.055701754385993,22.491052631578942,26.056140350877197,12.174698245614035,109.5690284879474,0.9175050463119466,0.016508194803162648,0.9703703703703704,0.9661691542288551,0.011031439602868174,0.18343070745764478,0.09967320261437908

300,"David Pearson Etter (March 18, 1928 – July 10, 2015) was an American poet. He was known for poems evoking small-town midwestern life. His most famous volume was written as 222 monologues in the voices of citizens of the imaginary community of “Alliance, Illinois,” which was based in part on his experiences living for many years in his adopted hometown of Elburn, Illinois.
 
Reviewing an early collection of his work, poet Lisel Mueller notes that Etter was “strongly influenced by Masters, Lindsay, and Sandburg, he is a chronicler of Midwest prairie towns and the disappearing race of semi-rural people, with their inarticulate dreams and dark secrets”. Poet Jay Paul noted that Etter converted colloquialism into “a poetic innovation that displays the variety and humor of midwestern speech.”  Etter's poems have been published in eight foreign countries and translated into German, Polish, and Japanese. He published thirty books and chapbooks of his own poems, which were included in over 100 textbooks and anthologies.

A member of the genus Iridomyrmex in the subfamily Dolichoderinae, it was described by British entomologist Frederick Smith in 1858. The meat ant is associated with many common names due to its appearance, nest-building behaviour and abundance, of which its specific name, purpureus, refers to its coloured appearance. It is among the best-known species of ant found throughout Australia; it occurs in almost all states and territories except for Tasmania. Its enormous distribution, aggression and ecological importance have made this ant a dominant species.

307,"Epoxy value derives from the Epoxy equivalent weight (EEW) or Weight Per Epoxide (WPE) and is a measure of the epoxy content of an epoxy resin or epoxy functional diluent. This is an important parameter as it allows determination of the correct mix ratio of an epoxy system with a curing agent. The epoxide equivalent weight is usually measured first and done by titration. The standard test method is ASTM D1652 though this has been modified by certain states of the USA. The epoxy equivalent weight (EEW) maybe defined as: the number of grams of epoxy resin required to give 1 mole of epoxy groups. The epoxy value is defined as the number of moles of epoxy group per 100g resin. Example calculations 
Polyoxypropylene diglycidyl ether a  reactive diluent with the trade name of Diluent F has an average molecular weight of 1000 and a functionality of 2 so the EEW is 1000/2 = 500.The epoxy group content (EGC) is a term which arises from the EEW and is usually found in the literature with units of m.mol/kg. So from the units it can be deduced that an epoxy resin with an EEW of 191 as above, has an epoxy group content of 1000000/191 = 5236 m.mol/kg. The epoxy value is defined as the number of moles of epoxy group per 100g resin. So as an example using the epoxy resin with an EEW of 191 and a molar mass of 382, the epoxy value is calculated as follows: 382g gives 2 moles of epoxy groups and therefore 100g = 100/382 x 2 = 0.53  i.e. the epoxy value of the resin is 0.53.",0.0,1.3941605839416058,5.554216867469879,24.90909090909091,0.3814814814814815,0.017427385892116183,-48.6728558718861,54.952330960854084,62.89039145907473,18.416011743772245,268.34603132661,0.836363245974099,0.029407162171705123,0.8941176470588237,0.8960863697705826,0.026937813144709697,0.1898897656800645,0.11209964412811388

310,"Bloody Creek crater, which is also known as the Bloody Creek structure, is a  in diameter elliptical feature that is located in southwestern Nova Scotia, Canada. It is argued to be either a possible extraterrestrial impact crater or an impact structure. It lies between Bridgetown and West Dalhousie, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia, where the Bloody Creek structure straddles what was once a stretch of Bloody Creek. It also is informally known as the Astrid crater. History 
The Bloody Creek structure was discovered by Dr. George R. Stevens, a retired geologist from Acadia University, in 1987 during a regional air photo survey. By the time of its discovery, it had been submerged beneath a reservoir, Dalhousie Lake. Dalhousie Lake was created by a dam constructed across Bloody Creek by the Nova Scotia Power Corporation as part of the Bloody Creek Reservoir hydroelectric development.

343,"The 1976 Çaldıran–Muradiye earthquake occurred at 14:22 local time (12:22 UTC) on 24 November. The epicenter was located near Çaldıran, 20 km northeast of Muradiye, in the Van Province of eastern Turkey. The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.3 with a maximum intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The area of severe damage, where over 80% of the buildings were destroyed, covered an area of 2,000 square kilometres. There were between 4,000 and 5,000 casualties. Tectonic setting
The easternmost part of Turkey lies within the complex zone of continuing continental collision between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The overall shortening that affects this area is accommodated partly by thrusting along the Bitlis-Zagros fold and thrust belt and partly by a mixture of sinistral strike-slip on SW-NE trending faults and dextral strike-slip on NW-SE trending faults. The earthquake was caused by movement on the Çaldıran Fault, one of the dextral faults, which had not been recognized before the earthquake. No earthquakes with magnitudes of 6 or greater were recorded within 100 km of Çaldıran in the preceding 74 years, possibly explaining why it was considered an area of only intermediate seismic risk (zone 3 out of the five-zone system of seismic risking used in Turkey at the time, with zone 1 being the highest).",0.0,1.348623853211009,6.448529411764706,24.22222222222222,0.3302752293577982,0.020282186948853614,-27.67249999999997,45.06722222222223,50.51111111111111,17.14658888888889,197.04433497536945,0.9010551749106945,0.018622433513701207,0.9025641025641028,0.8962962962962965,0.019801980198019802,0.17890795502532897,0.09868421052631578

The flame fougasse was developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department in Britain as an anti-tank weapon during the invasion crisis of 1940. During that period, about 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were deployed in some 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Although never used in combat in Britain, the design saw action later in Greece. Later in World War II, Germany and Russia developed flame throwing mines that worked on a somewhat different principle.

356,"The accessus ad auctores ('introduction to authors') was a literary genre of the Middle Ages. Originally, an accessus was the introduction at the beginning of a commentary on a classical author, containing background information on the author and his work. Beginning in the 12th century, these accessus were excerpted from the commentaries and published in separate collections. It is to these collections that modern scholars give the name accessus ad auctores. Invariably written in Latin, they were designed for the use of students of Latin grammar. The standard accessus was arranged as a series of questions in the form headings followed by their answers. Four distinct schemes of organization are recognized based on the choice of headings:
The Servian sheme is based on the prologue to Virgil's Aeneid written by the 4th-century grammarian Servius. It covers seven headings: (1) the life of the poet, (2) the title of the work, (3) its genre, (4) authorial intention, (5) the number of volumes, (6) the order of the volumes and (7) an explanation or interpretation.
The rhetorical scheme is based on the septem circumstantiae (seven circumstances) of classical rhetoric: (1) who, (2) what, (3) where, (4) by what means, (5) why, (6) how and (7) when. It was favoured, for example, by the 9th-century commentator Remigius of Auxerre.
The philosophical scheme is based on Boethius' introduction to his own commentary on the Isagoge of Porphyry. It covers six headings: (1) the intention of the work, (2) its utility, (3) its internal order, (4) the name of the author, (5) the title of the work and (6) the branch of philosophy to which it belongs.
The modern scheme represents a conscious break with those that came before. It was a simplified form of the philosophical scheme and was favoured by 12th-century modernists like Conrad of Hirsau. It used three or four headings: (1) the subject matter, (2) authorial intention, (3) the utility of the work and (4) the branch of philosophy to which it belongs. Utility was sometimes dropped.",0.0,1.4107142857142858,6.38659793814433,21.0,0.38392857142857145,0.027453271028037383,14.913020771513374,27.923299703264096,34.31905044510386,13.586038516320475,254.57032326552275,0.866090804205055,0.023303943726771914,0.8866666666666667,0.8845039018952068,0.02553862537888097,0.19534862370056305,0.10101744186046513

It views society as an interactive system where individuals are constantly shaped by their own experiences and those around them. Interactionists believe that people are not passive recipients of culture but active participants who shape it through their own behaviors and interactions with others. They also argue that individuals do not exist in isolation, but are part of larger social systems that influence their behavior and choices.
 2 The concept of interactionism was first introduced by the British sociologist Herbert Spencer in his book ""Theory of Social and Economic Evolution"" (1857). Interactionists believe that society is a complex system made up of many different elements, including individuals, institutions, culture, and history. They see these factors as interacting with each other to shape individual behavior and identity.

378,"Deal Castle is an artillery fort constructed by Henry VIII in Deal, Kent, between 1539 and 1540. It formed part of the King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the strategically important Downs anchorage off the English coast. Comprising a keep with six inner and outer bastions, the moated stone castle covered  and had sixty-six firing positions for artillery. It cost the Crown a total of £27,092 to build the three castles of Deal, Sandown and Walmer, which lay adjacent to one another along the coast and were connected by earthwork defences. The original invasion threat passed but, during the Second English Civil War of 1648–49, Deal was seized by pro-Royalist insurgents and was only retaken by Parliamentary forces after several months' fighting. Although it remained armed, Deal was adapted by Sir John Norris and Lord Carrington during the 18th and 19th centuries to form a more suitable private house for the castle's captain, which was by now an honorary position. In 1904, the War Office concluded that the castle no longer had any value either as a defensive site or as a barracks and it was opened to the public when the captain was not in residence. Early in the Second World War, the captain's quarters were destroyed by German bombing, forcing Deal's then-captain, William Birdwood, to move to Hampton Court Palace and the castle became an observation post for an artillery battery placed along the shore line. The castle was not brought back into use as a residence and was restored by the government during the 1950s to form a tourist attraction.

381,"The caper story is a subgenre of crime fiction.  The typical caper story involves one or more crimes (especially thefts, swindles, or occasionally kidnappings) perpetrated by the main characters in full view of the reader. The actions of police or detectives attempting to prevent or solve the crimes may also be chronicled, but are not the main focus of the story.  The caper story is distinguished from the straight crime story by elements of humor, adventure, or unusual cleverness or audacity. The main characters often have comical idiosyncrasies and the law enforcement individuals are characterized by ineptitude or inadequacies. The criminals comically plan a crime with details unnecessary for the nature of the crime and humour is created when their personalities clash and their quirks are exposed.  For instance, the Dortmunder stories of Donald E. Westlake are highly comic tales involving unusual thefts by a gang of offbeat characters — in different stories Dortmunder's gang steals the same gem several times, steals an entire branch bank, and kidnaps someone from an asylum by driving a stolen train onto the property.  By contrast, the same author's Parker stories (published under the name Richard Stark) are grimly straightforward accounts of mundane crime — the criminal equivalent of the police procedural.

401,"The Indiscreet Jewels (or The Indiscreet Toys, or The Talking Jewels; ) is the first novel by Denis Diderot, published anonymously in 1748. It is an allegory that portrays Louis XV of France as Mangogul, Sultan  of Congo, who owns a magic ring that makes women's vaginas (""jewels"") talk. The character of Mirzoza represents Louis XV's mistress Madame de Pompadour. Diderot portrayed Pompadour in a flattering light in The Indiscreet Jewels, most likely to ensure her support for his Encyclopedie. Plot summary
Sultan Mangogul of Congo is bored with life at court and suspects his mistress Mirzoza of infidelity. A genie presents him with a magical ring that has unique properties. When the ring is rubbed and pointed at the vagina of any woman the vagina begins speaking about its amorous experiences, to the confusion and consternation of its owner. The Sultan uses the ring about thirty times, usually at a dinner or other social gathering, and on these occasions the Sultan is typically visible to the woman. However, since the ring has the additional property of making its owner invisible when required, a few of the sexual experiences are recounted through direct observation, as the Sultan makes himself invisible in the unsuspecting woman's boudoir.",0.0,1.4829268292682927,6.346456692913386,22.77777777777778,0.37254901960784315,0.024691358024691357,-35.53923913043478,43.928623188405794,47.58357487922706,15.787877777777778,147.51625977943257,0.8970034853864255,0.019331626965529477,0.9230769230769232,0.931944444444445,0.014823585129055175,0.18001264116583673,0.10047846889952153

415,"Tongan Daopi  was a Zen Buddhist monk during the end of the Tang Dynasty and the beginning of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Very little is known about him. Traditional biographies record that he was the abbot of Tongan Monastery on Mount Fengchi near modern Nanchang. The earliest source of information on monks of this era is the Zutang ji (Patriarch's Hall Record), which was completed in 952, but it fails to mention Tongan Daopi as a disciple of his supposed teacher Yunju Daoying. The Zutang ji does, however, record someone with the name Tongan asking a question to Yunju Daoying. The scholar Ui Hakuju has written this could likely refer to Tongan Daopi. He is first explicitly mentioned in the Transmission of the Lamp, which was compiled around 1004. However, in that work, it does not mention Tongan Daopi as having any disciples. The commonly accepted version of his lineage holds that Tongan Guanzhi is Tongan Daopi's successor. However, this comes from Huihong's Sengbao zhuan, which was completed in 1119, much longer after Tongan's death than the other works. The Transmission of the Lamp instead claims that Tongan Guanzhi is the disciple of a Tongan Wei, in turn a student of Jufeng Puman, with Jufeng being an apparently obscure student of the famous Dongshan Liangjie. Both Tongan Wei and Jufeng Puman are listed for the first time in the Transmission of the Lamp, and neither with much information. However, Dayang Jingxuan, who in Huihong's version of the lineage is a descendant of Tonagan Daopi, is recorded in the Transmission of the Lamp as being descended through Jufeng Puman and Tongan Wei. Dayang was close with Wang Shu, one of the compilers of Transmission of the Lamp, suggesting that it is unlikely that an error would have been made therein about his lineage. This suggests that Tongan Guanzhi is much more likely to have been a student of Tongan Wei and not Tongan Daopi as commonly accepted.

She is regarded as ""one of the five most influential Chinese-born women writers in the postwar era and the progenitor of the Chinese students' overseas genre.""  She wrote primarily in Chinese, drawing on her experience as a Chinese émigré in postwar America. She was celebrated in the diaspora for giving voice to what she called the ""rootless generation"" — émigrés who had left for a better life but remained nostalgic for their homeland. She was more than a successful writer, but a bridge, a cultural ambassador between China and the US. In 1975, she was one of the first individuals to be invited back to China after relations between the two countries were re-opened. Her work, which until then had been blacklisted in China, began to focus on life in China.

Its only known member species, Heterodontosaurus tucki, was named in 1962 based on a skull discovered in South Africa. The genus name means ""different toothed lizard"", in reference to its unusual, heterodont dentition; the specific name honours G. C. Tuck, who supported the discoverers. Further specimens have since been found, including an almost complete skeleton in 1966.

431,"Baarìa is a 2009 Italian film directed by Giuseppe Tornatore. It was the opening film of the 66th Venice International Film Festival in September 2009. Plot
The film recounts life in the Sicilian town of Bagheria (known as Baarìa in Sicilian), from the 1930s to the 1980s, through the eyes of lovers Peppino (Francesco Scianna) and Mannina (Margareth Madè).
A Sicilian family depicted across three generations: from Cicco to his son Peppino to his grandson Pietro. Touching lightly on the private lives of these characters and their families, the film evokes the loves, dreams and disappointments of an entire community in the province of Palermo over five decades: during the Fascist period, Cicco is a shepherd who finds time to pursue his passion: books, epic poems, the great popular romance novels. In the days when people go hungry and during World War II, his son Peppino witnesses injustice by mafiosi and landowners. He becomes a communist. After the war, he encounters the woman of his life. Her family opposes the relationship because of his political ideas, but the two insist on marrying. They have children and raise their family.

432,"James Thomas Eaglestone (24 July 1923 – 14 October 2000) was an English cricketer who played 60 first-class cricket matches, initially for Middlesex in 1947, before moving to Glamorgan for the 1948 and 1949 seasons. Known largely for his skills as a fielder – for he found only moderate success with the bat – Eaglestone enjoys the unusual distinction of having featured in two different County Championship-winning sides in consecutive seasons. Career
Eaglestone was drawn to cricket after leaving school in 1938 when he joined the groundstaff at Lord's Cricket Ground. He played for the Middlesex Second XI that year. A left-handed batsman, Eaglestone enjoyed limited success after a promising debut first-class game for the Marylebone Cricket Club in which he scored 77 in a 128-run partnership with Denis Compton. Having securing selection for Middlesex, he scored zero in his first outing for the county side, and though he made 55 in his next game he would score only seven half-centuries during his career and finish with a batting average of 15.77. 
 
Eaglestone played only seven matches for Middlesex in that solitary season for the club, scoring 151 runs. He decided to move to Glamorgan at the end of that year's County Championship – of which Middlesex were crowned champions. He played for Glamorgan in the 1948 season, and Glamorgan were victorious in that year's County Championship also – their maiden County Championship victory. This meant that Eaglestone had featured in Championship winning teams for two successive summers. His own contributions, however, were relatively modest. He scored 595 runs at 18.59 in the 1948 season and 341 runs at 11.36 in 1949.",0.0,1.3308823529411764,6.238636363636363,22.666666666666668,0.3125,0.019176136363636364,15.154656593406614,28.100760073260073,30.96300366300366,14.020198168498169,131.84,0.8773379289505365,0.022215510147440255,0.9458333333333334,0.9435028248587588,0.013236947791164659,0.16463677729607043,0.09622302158273381

Different from reforestation projects, Pwojè Pyebwa promoted agroforestry—the strategic mixing of crops, trees, and animals. The agroforestry project in Haiti project was funded by the United States Agency for International Development USAID, but implemented through the Pan American Development Organization (PADF) and CARE. It was originally called the Agroforestry Outreach Project (AOP). The original project spanned a decade (1981–1991), but policies from Pwojè Pyebwa continued to direct PADF tree-planting through a second decade (1992 to 2000). The project was executed throughout the country. Based on Haitian farmers’ voluntary and widespread participation, the project has been deemed a success by many. Pwojè Pyebwa distributed free trees to farmers, and advised on the incorporation of trees into existing cropping arrangements based on anthropological research into the land tenure, agricultural systems, and the historical market-orientation of Haitian peasant farmers. The project eventually won the Praxis prize in applied anthropology. It is estimated that the project involved one-third of the entire rural Haitian population.

It is commonly used in cases where the cervix is too high or tight to allow for normal labor. The device is made of soft materials such as cotton and is placed into the neck through small incisions. The goal of the procedure is to create more space between the cervix and the baby's head, which can help prevent complications during delivery. Cervical cerclage has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of premature birth, instrumental deliveries (where forceps or vacuum are used to assist with delivery), and other birthing complications.

They are thought to have been created under the direction of tobacco merchant, landowner and philanthropist Joseph Williamson between 1810 and 1840. Although popularly described as ""tunnels"", the majority comprise brick or stone vaulting over excavations in the underlying sandstone. The purpose of the works remains unclear and remains a subject of heavy speculation; suggestions include commercial quarrying, a philanthropic desire to provide employment, and Williamson's own eccentric interests. After being gradually infilled with rubble and spoil during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they remained largely inaccessible until archaeological investigations were carried out in 1995. Since then volunteers have rediscovered and excavated an extensive network of tunnels, chambers and voids across several sites, with sections open to the public.

449,"Hans Hass (23 January 1919 – 16 June 2013) was an Austrian biologist and underwater diving pioneer. He was known mainly for being among the first scientists to popularise coral reefs, stingrays, octopuses and sharks. He pioneered the making of documentaries filmed underwater and led the development of a type of rebreather. He is also known for his energon theory and his commitment to protecting the environment. Early years
Hass was born in Vienna; his father was an attorney and Hass initially pursued law. However, Hass had a formative encounter with the American diver Guy Gilpatric while on a Riviera holiday in 1938 which included underwater hunting and photography. After making expeditions to the Caribbean Sea and writing his first professional articles in 1938-39, in 1940 Hass switched from reading law to studying zoology and graduated with a Ph.D. from the University of Berlin in 1943 at the Faculty of Biology. His thesis was the first scientific research project that used an autonomous rebreather diving equipment. In his early diving he used rebreathers, which he had made for him by the German diving gear makers Dräger: he had these sets made with the breathing bag on his back, as he did not like the bag-on-chest ""frogman look"".

The album took listeners on a journey through a haunted Victorian mansion through the blend of symphonic gothic horror instrumental music and horror-inspired soundscape the band had become known for. Since its release, it has become one of the band's most popular titles, winning awards in the gaming industry  and inspiring the prequel-themed album, Bloodlines, in 2021. Background

The sound effects were based on real-life stories of paranormal experiences ... the (album) is our audio interpretation of an actual haunted house.  Both Goszka and Edward Douglas also credit their love of ghost stories, horror movies, and their studio (a fully restored Victorian era home) as further inspiration for the album. Douglas mentioned that some of the soundscape on the album was inspired by a presentation George Lutz gave describing his experiences in the house that became the basis for the book, The Amityville Horror.

455,"Archaeopteryx , sometimes referred to by its German name, """" (lit. 'original bird' or 'first bird'), is a genus of bird-like dinosaurs. The name derives from the ancient Greek  (archaīos), meaning ""ancient"", and  (ptéryx), meaning ""feather"" or ""wing"". Between the late 19th century and the early 21st century, Archaeopteryx was generally accepted by palaeontologists and popular reference books as the oldest known bird (member of the group Avialae). Older potential avialans have since been identified, including Anchiornis, Xiaotingia, and Aurornis. Archaeopteryx lived in the Late Jurassic around 150 million years ago, in what is now southern Germany, during a time when Europe was an archipelago of islands in a shallow warm tropical sea, much closer to the equator than it is now. Similar in size to a Eurasian magpie, with the largest individuals possibly attaining the size of a raven, the largest species of Archaeopteryx could grow to about  in length. Despite their small size, broad wings, and inferred ability to fly or glide, Archaeopteryx had more in common with other small Mesozoic dinosaurs than with modern birds.

From cropmarks in the ""policies"" (improved areas) around Fetteresso Castle, there is evidence of a ring ditch sited at the north end of a cursus.  A cursus is a prehistoric set of parallel linear structures of unknown purpose that were, somewhat fancifully, considered by antiquarians as used for some type of athletic competition, possibly related to hunting or archery; this is unsubstantiated. In 1822 a cairn was discovered near Fetteresso Castle with some human remains inside. The size and shape of the chamber made of unhewn whinstone clearly show that the burial site was a Bronze Age construct.

The series focuses on a young boy named Todd Casil, otherwise known as Squee. An introverted and bullied little kid with a less than supportive family, Squee has been forced to mature a bit more quickly than his peers. He is fond of writing, but only receives criticism from his teacher and taunting from his classmates.

Many rifles and shotguns are manufactured with a standard length of pull assumed to fit most shooters. This is often approximately  for rifles and about  longer for shotguns. Shooters with short arms may find the buttstock dragging along the underside of their arm as they attempt to raise the firearm into firing position. Shooters with broad shoulders or a long neck may experience face injuries from collision with the telescopic sight or thumb of the trigger hand as the firearm recoils. Modern firearms may be equipped with a telescoping stock or removable spacers to adjust the length of pull. Gunsmiths may adjust the length of pull of custom-built firearms or older firearms by cutting off a portion of the buttstock or adding a recoil pad to the buttstock. Some sources suggest a shooter's optimum length of pull will allow the butt of the firearm to exactly reach the inside of the elbow when the hand of that arm grips the unloaded firearm with a finger on the trigger. Other sources suggest a more appropriate determination may be made using a non-firing ""try-gun"" resembling a firearm with an adjustable buttstock. When a properly adjusted try-gun is held in a firing position, the shooter's nose should be about two finger-widths behind the thumb of the trigger hand.",0.0,1.310580204778157,6.34319526627219,26.636363636363637,0.43686006825938567,0.014705882352941176,-62.75139830508472,58.655,63.203389830508485,15.823313559322035,206.83711577133008,0.8775196434103445,0.02153699443292203,0.9017543859649124,0.8994068801898,0.020754064337599448,0.1725829429990288,0.13366336633663367
488,"A sheave  or pulley wheel is a grooved wheel often used for holding a belt, wire rope, or rope and incorporated into a pulley. The sheave spins on an axle or bearing inside the frame of the pulley. This allows the wire or rope to move freely, minimizing friction and wear on the cable. Sheaves can be used to redirect a cable or rope, lift loads, and transmit power. The words sheave and pulley are sometimes used interchangeably. Adjustable pulley
A sheave can also refer to a pulley which has an adjustable operating diameter for use with a mechanical belt. This is accomplished by constructing the pulley out of several pieces. The two main ""halves"" of the pulley can be moved closer together or farther apart, thus altering the operational diameter. The usual construction is some sort of locking collar or set screws to secure the components, one half with a threaded central shaft and one half with a threaded center. By rotating the components, one can ""screw"" the parts closer together or further apart, thus changing the distance between the two halves and allowing the belt to ride higher or lower in the groove. The adjustments are constrained to a specific range of sizes and are not limitless. One application of this is the Variomatic automatic transmission.",0.0,1.2844036697247707,6.014705882352941,18.166666666666668,0.40825688073394495,0.023696682464454975,-29.92385321100916,44.51174311926606,48.9211009174312,14.764964220183485,178.43615857251072,0.8795993669165358,0.02236061723141378,0.9000000000000001,0.9071895424836615,0.017925844501754534,0.16841782373022748,0.1318181818181818

This type of politics is often associated with the rise of social media, which has made it easier for individuals and groups to organize and mobilize support for populist candidates. Populism in Canada has been seen as a response to what many perceive as a political system that favors special interests and elitists rather than ordinary people. Populist movements have gained traction in recent years, particularly with the rise of the Canadian Freedom Party and the People's Party of Canada, which both advocate for anti-immigrant policies and an economic nationalist agenda.

She is also a triple European champion with the Norwegian national team, which she previously captained prior to the reign of fellow Gjøvik handballer Gro Hammerseng. She is the only player on the Norwegian team that received all the first five gold medals that the national team won up to the 2008 Olympics.  Ending her career for Nordstrand in her second spell, she has previously played for Leipzig, Nordstrand, Snertingdal and Toten. International career 
2 November 1997, Sørlie Lybekk debuted in a friendly against Germany, marking the beginning of a long career for the Norwegian side.  She participated in consecutive international championships from her debut in the 1998 European Championships until the 2008 Olympics, except for the 2004 European Championships where she was dropped after having suffered injuries preventing her from a necessary build-up, and the World Championships the following year. At the 2004 European championship she was not included in the main team, but was listed as home reserve. When Isabel Blanco injured her thumb during the championship, Sørlie Lybekk was called to join the team, and received a gold medal from the championship without playing.

The concept was first introduced by Adam Smith in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, written in 1759. According to Smith, it is literally divine providence, that is the hand of God, that works to make this happen. By the time he wrote The Wealth of Nations in 1776, Smith had studied the economic models of the French Physiocrats for many years, and in this work, the invisible hand is more directly linked to production, to the employment of capital in support of domestic industry.

In women with a prior spontaneous preterm birth and who are pregnant with one baby, and have shortening of the cervical length less than 25 mm, a cerclage prevents a preterm birth and reduces death and illness in the baby. The treatment consists of a strong suture sewn into and around the cervix early in the pregnancy, usually between weeks 12 to 14, and then removed towards the end of the pregnancy when the greatest risk of miscarriage has passed. The procedure is performed under local anaesthesia, usually by way of a spinal block. It is typically performed on an outpatient basis by an obstetrician-gynecologist. Usually the treatment is done in the first or second trimester of pregnancy, for a woman who has had one or more late miscarriages in the past.

520,"Currency war, also known as competitive devaluations, is a condition in international affairs where countries seek to gain a trade advantage over other countries by causing the exchange rate of their currency to fall in relation to other currencies. As the exchange rate of a country's currency falls, exports become more competitive in other countries, and imports into the country become more and more expensive. Both effects benefit the domestic industry, and thus employment, which receives a boost in demand from both domestic and foreign markets. However, the price increases for import goods (as well as in the cost of foreign travel) are unpopular as they harm citizens' purchasing power; and when all countries adopt a similar strategy, it can lead to a general decline in international trade, harming all countries. Historically, competitive devaluations have been rare as countries have generally preferred to maintain a high value for their currency. Countries have generally allowed market forces to work, or have participated in systems of managed exchanges rates. An exception occurred when a currency war broke out in the 1930s when countries abandoned the gold standard during the Great Depression and used currency devaluations in an attempt to stimulate their economies. Since this effectively pushes unemployment overseas, trading partners quickly retaliated with their own devaluations. The period is considered to have been an adverse situation for all concerned, as unpredictable changes in exchange rates reduced overall international trade.",0.0,1.459915611814346,7.2785714285714285,26.333333333333332,0.3881856540084388,0.018811136192626036,-186.16189075630248,98.35100840336135,104.61176470588235,21.94306470588235,104.15931078313679,0.9004038687018007,0.01820014711212703,0.968888888888889,0.9505952380952387,0.010459880154593483,0.1497523520177269,0.14705882352941177

Born into the Liebling family of musicians, she began her professional opera career in Dresden as a leading coloratura soprano in 1898 when she was just 18 years old. She sang with several important opera houses in Europe, including the Opéra-Comique, the Semperoper, and the Staatsoper Stuttgart.

529,"A topological insulator is a material that behaves as an insulator in its interior but whose surface contains conducting states, meaning that electrons can only move along the surface of the material. Topological insulators have non-trivial symmetry-protected topological order; however, having a conducting surface is not unique to topological insulators, since ordinary band insulators can also support conductive surface states. What is special about topological insulators is that their surface states are symmetry-protected Dirac fermions by particle number conservation and time-reversal symmetry. In two-dimensional (2D) systems, this ordering is analogous to a conventional electron gas subject to a strong external magnetic field causing electronic excitation gap in the sample bulk and metallic conduction at the boundaries or surfaces. The distinction between 2D and 3D topological insulators is characterized by the Z-2 topological invariant, which defines the ground state. In 2D, there is a single Z-2 invariant distinguishing the insulator from the quantum spin-Hall phase, while in 3D, there are four Z-2 invariant that differentiate the insulator from “weak” and “strong” topological insulators.",0.0,1.819767441860465,7.368421052631579,28.666666666666668,0.3430232558139535,0.01440922190201729,-136.4531395348837,75.0213953488372,81.5906976744186,19.32828139534884,129.79989183342346,0.9003854222877683,0.019352051403054224,0.9151515151515153,0.9333333333333325,0.013055895552835577,0.1860161061171827,0.15168539325842698

In May 1941 part of Oflag XIII-A Langwasser, Nuremberg, was separated off, and a new camp, designated Oflag XIII-B, created for Yugoslavian officers, predominantly Serbs captured in the Balkans Campaign. In April 1943 at least 3,000 Serbian officers were moved from Langwasser to Hammelburg.

531,"Musafia is an Italian manufacturer of violin cases. They specialise in high-end violin cases, which are handmade at their workshop in Cremona, Italy.  Their cases are internationally renowned and are used by many leading soloists including Sarah Chang, Joshua Bell, Salvatore Accardo, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Isaac Stern, Uto Ughi, and Chloë Hanslip. History
The company was founded in 1983 by violinist and luthier Dimitri Musafia, who studied violin making at the Stradivari Institute. Musafia's objective was to create a violin case which focused primarily on instrument safety and aesthetics. After experimenting with variety of different materials over several years, a ""specially-milled wood laminate"" emerged as the preferred choice for the basis of construction, satisfying the requirements for both instrument safety and portability. Since then, Musafia cases have been the preferred choice for some of the most famous and expensive violins in the world, including Guarneris and the 1715 Stradivarius ""Cremonese"", previously played by Joseph Joachim. The construction specifics have changed over the years to ensure that their high standards are upheld. Up to this day, Musafia has remained a family-owned business, with all aspects of design and construction taking place in the company's Cremona workshop and overseen by Dmitri personally.",0.0,1.5979899497487438,7.023076923076923,22.11111111111111,0.37185929648241206,0.02700348432055749,-52.16652985074626,45.50251243781095,49.3542288557214,16.39846417910448,94.44205954395092,0.9195643575483922,0.015195732177731593,0.9282051282051283,0.9452252252252256,0.009491903964265773,0.1660609584257799,0.10869565217391303

Off-off-Broadway is a term used to describe small theaters in New York City that produce experimental, independent, and avant-garde works. These theaters are often located in Manhattan neighborhoods such as the East Village, Greenwich Village, and Chelsea. They provide a platform for artists to showcase their work without the constraints of traditional Broadway theater formats. Off-off-Broadway theaters offer audiences a unique opportunity to experience new and innovative performances that may not be seen on Broadway.

535,"The common woolly monkey, brown woolly monkey, or Humboldt's woolly monkey (Lagothrix lagothricha) is a woolly monkey from Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, and Venezuela. It lives in groups of two to 70 individuals, usually splitting the group into smaller subgroups when active. Taxonomy
The taxonomy of the common woolly monkey is still debated. Fooden classified it is as one of two species under the genus Lagothrix with four sub-species (L. l. lagotricha, L. l. lugens, L. l. cana, and L. l. poeppgigii. Later, an analysis of craniodental morphology suggested a move of all sub-species to the species level and also led to the yellow-tailed woolly monkey (formerly Lagothrix flavicauda) being moved to a monotypic genus Oreonax. Genetic analyses also identify distinct groups, but different groupings from morphological and molecular data continue to make this a difficult issue that might be addressed with larger data sets. A 2014 study found the genus Lagothrix to comprise only two species: L. lagothrica and L. flavicauda, with L. lagothrica containing five subspecies; the results of this study have been followed by the American Society of Mammalogists and the IUCN Red List.",0.0,1.6170212765957446,6.348837209302325,26.857142857142858,0.30319148936170215,0.034653465346534656,-34.11107142857139,41.49357142857143,44.572486772486776,16.34401746031746,134.9766936429409,0.9002929486377454,0.019060405482883562,0.8944444444444445,0.9009633911368022,0.013570237479155886,0.1959729111610898,0.11010362694300517
536,"Robert Powell (born 1932 in Benoit, Mississippi) is an American composer, organist, and choir director. Powell earned a Bachelor of Music degree from Louisiana State University with a focus on organ and composition.  He studied with Alec Wyton at Union Theological Seminary in New York, and he was also Wyton's assistant at The Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine.  For three years (1965–1968), he served St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire) as Director of Music.  Later, Powell was Director of Music and Organist of Christ Church (Episcopal) of Greenville, South Carolina from 1968 to 2003.  He has composed in nearly all genres common to church music, including anthems, service music, hymn concertatos, organ music, music for handbell choir, and large-scale oratorios.  Powell's conservative, neo-Romantic style stems from his practical approach to composition.  According to Powell himself, he writes for ""choirs of twenty-five because that's what most choirs are.  When you come right down to it, most choirs are not of cathedral ability or size.   My pieces are all practical things and useful for specific occasions.""  His publications appear in The Hymnal 1982 as well as in the catalogs of most of the significant American publishers of church music.  According to publisher GIA, Powell is ""a composer whose output bridges denominational boundaries and who is able to serve the larger Church.

Dodson suggested that the ruler that Kenneth Kitchen, in his standard work on Third Intermediate Period chronology, had numbered Shoshenq IV – bearing the prenomen Usermaatre – should be removed from the 22nd Dynasty and replaced by Rohl's Hedjkheperre Shoshenq (b), renumbering the latter as Shoshenq IV. At the same time the old Usermaatre Shoshenq IV was renumbered as Shoshenq VI. Dodson's historical summary of the new King Shoshenq IV's discovery and his supportive evidence for that king's independent existence from Hedjkheperre Shoshenq I appeared in an article entitled ‘A New King Shoshenq Confirmed?’ in 1993.",0.0,1.3027522935779816,6.136363636363637,36.333333333333336,0.2889908256880734,0.020185029436501262,-144.25175675675672,88.53054054054053,94.3855855855856,23.182835135135136,177.6859504132231,0.8813345286181568,0.022001050380665438,0.9190476190476191,0.932362459546927,0.0178497301784973,0.1978475876913218,0.08520179372197309

The book was published in 2015, and it argues that the United States has become ""crippled"" due to its economic decline and moral decay. It suggests that the solution to these problems is to return to traditional values and principles of American conservatism. The title of the book refers to a phrase coined by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936, which criticized the New Deal policies of his administration as being ""crippling"" to the economy. Huckabee's book argues that similar policies are still relevant today and suggests that a return to traditional values can help restore America's greatness.",1.0,1.5132743362831858,6.493333333333333,22.6,0.35398230088495575,0.023026315789473683,-51.13521739130431,48.96086956521739,52.608695652173914,16.06841304347826,128.43605607330252,0.9132925579844472,0.01834151234056578,0.942857142857143,0.9521885521885524,0.012958280657395701,0.1740858940693561,0.10991379310344827

578,"Jugendstil (""Youth Style"") was an artistic movement, particularly in the decorative arts, that was influential primarily in Germany and elsewhere in Europe to a lesser extent from about 1895 until about 1910.  It was the German counterpart of Art Nouveau. The members of the movement were reacting against the historicism and neo-classicism of the official art and architecture academies. It took its name from the art journal Jugend, founded by the German artist Georg Hirth. It was especially active in the graphic arts and interior decoration. Its major centers of activity were Munich and Weimar and the Darmstadt Artists' Colony founded in Darmstadt in 1901. Important figures of the movement included the Swiss graphic artist Hermann Obrist, Otto Eckmann, and the Belgian architect and decorator Henry van de Velde. In its earlier years, the style was influenced by Modern Style (British Art Nouveau style). It was also influenced  by Japanese prints.

Timberland Regional Library has 27 community libraries, 2 cooperative library centers, and 3 library kiosks. It was founded in 1968, following a four-year demonstration project, and is funded through property taxes and timber taxes. History
A two-year demonstration library system, the Timberland Library Demonstration (TLD), was established in 1964 to serve Grays Harbor, Lewis, Mason, Pacific, and Thurston counties, using $310,000 in funds from the federal Library Services and Construction Act and local sources. Each of the counties had cities with independent library systems and several rural library districts, including the Grays Harbor County Rural Library District and South Puget Sound Regional Library, who chose to either join or opt out of the demonstration project. The Timberland Library Demonstration relied on the Washington State Library to process its books, which were also stored in municipal libraries. The system debuted its bookmobile in September 1964, based in Centralia and traveling on ten routes between rural areas in all five counties. The formation of a permanent library district would require a public vote, which was pushed back from 1966 to 1968, waiting for a more favorable general election. The South Puget Sound Regional Library, which comprised Mason and Thurston counties, threatened to leave the demonstration later in 1966 over the effectiveness of the program for their counties. After months of negotiation, the two counties reversed their decision, allowing the demonstration project to continue for another two years.",0.0,1.534351145038168,6.791208791208791,26.2,0.3015267175572519,0.024617431803060547,-73.96373574144485,56.24404942965779,59.13992395437263,17.663652851711028,148.02217183169566,0.885776763285201,0.020657329157684583,0.9208333333333334,0.9243697478991609,0.01486119015999494,0.18389880175592244,0.09868421052631578

585,"The Physician's Visit is a 1660-1662 oil painting on a canvas painting by the Dutch artist Jan Steen, now seen in the Apsley House collection in London. Its subject is similar to his The Lovesick Maiden in the Metropolitan Museum of Art from the same era. The painting is a representation of how women were treated when treated by doctors in the 1600s. The painting features several small details and disguised symbolism that may go unnoticed to the common eye, but nevertheless contribute to the painting's meaning. Visual Analysis 
This painting is a visual representation of medical practices that were performed on women in the 1660s. Jan Steen uses very direct facial expressions to show what the people in this painting were feeling. Women in paintings such as this and The Lovesick Maiden  are usually young, pretty and well dressed, while being positioned upward in a chair. The facial expressions in these paintings often had a vacant and senseless look while the doctor takes the woman's pulse. In other similar examples, the doctor may also be looking at the urine sample that an assistant holds up to the light.  The backgrounds of these paintings tend to have elegant paintings on the walls..The woman sitting down on the right is suffering from illness, which during the time was not only hard to identify, but also extremely difficult to treat. Paintings consistently represent women in a fragile, passive, housebound way which was much more of a  male wish, rather than a female reality. Women in these paintings are often presented to be weak, and surrounded by concerned family members.",0.0,1.3333333333333333,6.286624203821656,22.25,0.38202247191011235,0.020973782771535582,-53.69528597785977,54.41071955719556,59.21845018450185,15.601211439114392,155.55555555555557,0.8985456898808751,0.018121947731370408,0.9215686274509804,0.9195312500000017,0.015613382899628252,0.16784825683843854,0.1177536231884058

591,"In Finnish folklore, all places and things, and also human beings, have a haltija (a genius, guardian spirit) of their own.  One such haltija is called etiäinen—an image, doppelgänger, or just an impression that goes ahead of a person, doing things the person in question later does. For example, people waiting at home might hear the door close or even see a shadow or a silhouette, only to realize that no one has yet arrived. Etiäinen can also refer to some kind of a feeling that something is going to happen. Sometimes it could, for example, warn of a bad year coming. In modern Finnish, the term has detached from its shamanistic origins and refers to premonition. Unlike clairvoyance, divination, and similar practices, etiäiset (plural) are spontaneous and can't be induced. Quite the opposite, they may be unwanted and cause anxiety, like ghosts. Etiäiset need not be too dramatic and may concern everyday events, although ones related to e.g. deaths are common. As these phenomena are still reported today, they can be considered a living tradition, as a way to explain the psychological experience of premonition.",0.0,1.413978494623656,6.285714285714286,16.90909090909091,0.3924731182795699,0.035181236673773986,-116.15238095238092,76.4131216931217,82.584126984127,18.441323280423283,72.43096423721141,0.9339068709125623,0.012621762936854696,0.9555555555555556,0.9532567049808438,0.007281829559676869,0.1733205959670135,0.13095238095238093

639,"An awning or overhang is a secondary covering attached to the exterior wall of a building. It is typically composed of canvas woven of acrylic, cotton or polyester yarn, or vinyl laminated to polyester fabric that is stretched tightly over a light structure of aluminium, iron or steel, possibly wood or transparent material (used to cover solar thermal panels in the summer, but that must allow as much light as possible in the winter). The configuration of this structure is something of a truss, space frame or planar frame. Awnings are also often constructed of aluminium understucture with aluminium sheeting. These aluminium awnings are often used when a fabric awning is not a practical application where snow load as well as wind loads may be a factor. The location of an awning on a building may be above a window, a door, or above the area along a sidewalk. With the addition of columns an awning becomes a canopy, which is able to extend further from a building, as in the case of an entrance to a hotel. Restaurants often use awnings broad enough to cover substantial outdoor area for outdoor dining, parties, or reception. In commercial buildings, an awning is often painted with information as to the name, business, and address, thus acting as a sign or billboard as well as providing shade, breaking strong winds, and protecting from rain or snow. In areas with wintry weather, most awnings do not have to be taken down at the end of the summer – they can remain retracted against the building all winter long, or be designed and built for those conditions.",0.0,1.400735294117647,6.324675324675325,27.2,0.4411764705882353,0.023023791250959325,-200.90527675276752,108.60553505535054,114.30405904059042,21.739354612546123,123.90898816737243,0.8979527357833701,0.018215833594298052,0.914814814814815,0.917250324254216,0.012436791034577012,0.1664600870229614,0.13419117647058823

646,"In micro-sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective that sees social behavior as an interactive product of the individual and the situation. In other words, it derives social processes (such as conflict, cooperation, identity formation) from social interaction, whereby subjectively held meanings are integral to explaining or understanding social behavior. This perspective studies the ways in which individuals shape, and are shaped by, society through their interactions. Interactionism thus argues that the individual is an active and conscious piece of the social-context system, rather than merely a passive object in their environment. It believes interactions to be guided by meanings that are attached to the self, to others with whom each individual interacts, and to situations of interaction; all of which are altered in interaction themselves. In this sense, interactionism may stand in contrast to studies of socialization, insofar as interactionism conceives individuals to influence groups at least as much as groups influence individuals.",0.0,1.6274509803921569,7.988636363636363,25.5,0.41830065359477125,0.020765027322404372,-111.02470588235292,66.75450980392156,72.70326797385621,18.862293464052286,109.359647998633,0.9010347735090674,0.01967328253273403,0.9466666666666669,0.942446043165467,0.011007911936704506,0.1870451570625589,0.13870967741935483

661,"Transferable development rights (TDR) is a method by which developers can purchase the development rights of certain parcels within a designated ""sending district"" and transfer the rights to another ""receiving district"" to increase the density of their new development. The underlying legal concept of a transfer of development rights programme is the notion that all land has a bundle of property rights. It is used for controlling land use to complement land-use planning and zoning for more effective urban growth management and land conservation. Description 
The TDR process can be considered a tool for controlling urban sprawl by concentrating development. TDR is a legal mechanism offered in some local government jurisdictions as a form of development control. In the United States, TDR are also a way to avoid constitutional takings issues caused by rezoning areas that would otherwise eliminate a significant amount of value from the property. The procedure offers landowners financial incentives or bonuses for the conservation and maintenance of the environmental, heritage or agricultural values of their land. TDR is based on the concept that with land ownership comes the right of use of land, or land development. These land-based development rights can in some jurisdictions be used, unused, sold, or otherwise transferred by the owner of a parcel.

Naranjo de Bulnes is part of the Cabrales region of Asturias, and lies within the Picos de Europa National Park.

As far as is known the etymology of this name is not clear, because, historically, the local inhabitants always referred to the mountain as ""Picu Urriellu"". It has been suggested that the name can be attributed to the orange hue of the limestone from which the peak is formed.

668,"Asius of Samos (, Asios ho Samios) was an ancient Greek poet whose work survives in the form of fragments quoted by other ancient authors. All that is known about the man is that he was from Samos and that his father's name was Amphiptolemus. His era is inferred from the style and content of the remains, which suit the archaizing movement of the sixth century BCE. Antiquity left no titles or synopses, so the number, scope and focus of his works is unknown, but to judge from the ancient testimonia and the content of the fragments themselves he appears to have specialized in genealogical epic comparable to the fragmentary Hesiodic Catalogue of Women. Asius' preserved genealogies show a preoccupation with Hesiod's Boeotia, in addition to details concerning his own native Samos. Besides the 13 fragments surviving from his hexametric poetry, there is a short and enigmatic fragment in elegiacs.

It gives the particle the same acceleration as all those actual forces together as described by Newton's second law of motion. It is possible to determine the torque associated with the point of application of a net force so that it maintains the movement of jets of the object under the original system of forces. Its associated torque, the net force, becomes the resultant force and has the same effect on the rotational motion of the object as all actual forces taken together.  It is possible for a system of forces to define a torque-free resultant force. In this case, the net force, when applied at the proper line of action, has the same effect on the body as all of the forces at their points of application.

Originally concerned with infants and children, the field has expanded to include adolescence, adult development, aging, and the entire lifespan. Developmental psychologists aim to explain how thinking, feeling, and behaviors change throughout life.  This field examines change across three major dimensions, which are physical development, cognitive development, and social emotional development. Within these three dimensions are a broad range of topics including motor skills, executive functions, moral understanding, language acquisition, social change, personality, emotional development, self-concept, and identity formation. Developmental psychology examines the influences of nature and nurture on the process of human development, as well as processes of change in context across time.

His interdisciplinary research interests encompass a broad area of energy, environmental, food, population, economic, historical and public policy studies. He has also applied these approaches to energy, food and environmental affairs of China. Early life and education
Smil was born during WWII in Plzeň, at that time in the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (present-day Czech Republic). His father was a police officer and his mother a book keeper. Growing up in a remote mountain town in the Plzeň Region, Smil cut wood daily to keep the home heated. This provided an early lesson in energy efficiency and density.
 
Smil completed his undergraduate studies at the Faculty of Natural Sciences of Charles University in Prague, where he took 35 classes a week, 10 months a year, for 5 years. ""They taught me nature, from geology to clouds,"" Smil said.

680,"Therapeutic touch (commonly shortened to ""TT""), known by some as ""non-contact therapeutic touch"" (NCTT), is a pseudoscientific energy therapy which practitioners claim promotes healing and reduces pain and anxiety. ""Therapeutic Touch"" is a registered trademark in Canada for the ""[s]tructured and standardized healing practice performed by practitioners trained to be sensitive to the receiver's energy field that surrounds the body;...no touching is required."" Practitioners of therapeutic touch state that by placing their hands on, or near, a patient, they are able to detect and manipulate what they say is the patient's energy field. One highly cited study, designed by the then-nine-year-old Emily Rosa and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1998, found that practitioners of therapeutic touch could not detect the presence or absence of a hand placed a few inches above theirs when their vision was obstructed. Simon Singh and Edzard Ernst concluded in their 2008 book Trick or Treatment that ""the energy field was probably nothing more than a figment in the imaginations of the healers"". The American Cancer Society noted, ""Available scientific evidence does not support any claims that TT can cure cancer or other diseases.""

Not only did she do ethnographic field work, but she also trained with a retired lucha libre wrestler and his students. Levi worked with this well respected wrestler for a year and a half and incorporated this as research into her book The World of Lucha Libre  This allowed Levi to view lucha libre as an arena that examined the connections between ideas of mestizaje, class, gender, aesthetic values, mass mediation, and the state. This thus led her to write her book The World of Lucha Libra in which these ideas are explored.

691,"A sky anchor is a system of two balloons in tandem, with a ""zero-pressure"" lifting gas balloon tethered to a superpressure balloon ""anchor"". The gas balloon is filled with a lifting gas and provides the buoyancy, while the superpressure balloon is filled with air, and pressurized to provide the desired ballast weight. In a passive sky anchor, the superpressure balloon is sealed, while in an active system, its pressure can be varied. Both versions have been tested in flight, but have had frequent failures with only occasional successful outcomes. The tandem arrangement makes launching difficult, and this complexity can lead to mission failure. The tandem balloon system is intended to increase the flight time of the zero-pressure balloon by damping the diurnal  altitude variations caused by solar heating of the lifting gas and its subsequent expansion. As the balloons descend, the superpressure balloon's constant volume displaces a larger mass of the denser air, and becomes more buoyant. Likewise as they rise, the system displaces less air mass, limiting the ascent to prevent the lifting gas from expanding too far and escaping from the zero pressure balloon.",0.0,1.3655913978494623,6.466666666666667,23.25,0.3655913978494624,0.025303643724696356,-115.0726737967914,75.76566844919786,81.00320855614973,19.83565721925134,180.1595699047728,0.8803430636386087,0.022874106642683294,0.9111111111111113,0.9183044315992294,0.01811281697429705,0.16757260812274105,0.1394736842105263

723,"With physical damage or disease suffered by an organism, healing involves the repair of living tissue(s), organs and the biological system as a whole and resumption of (normal) functioning. Medicine includes the process by which the cell(s) in the body regenerate and repair to reduce the size of a damaged or necrotic area and replace it with new living tissue. The replacement can happen in two ways: by regeneration in which the necrotic cells are replaced by new cells that form ""like"" tissue as was originally there; or by repair in which injured tissue is replaced with scar tissue. Most organs will heal using a mixture of both mechanisms. Within surgery healing is more often referred to as recovery, and postoperative recovery has historically been viewed simply as restitution of function and readiness for discharge. More recently, postoperative recovery has been described as an energy‐requiring process to decrease physical symptoms, reach a level of emotional well‐being, regain functions, and re‐establish activities",0.0,1.4409937888198758,7.010416666666667,26.833333333333332,0.38509316770186336,0.018369690011481057,-109.45018072289153,69.7644578313253,75.3156626506024,18.71877469879518,105.38597613760398,0.9021093828682062,0.01921778910875716,0.9400000000000001,0.9472035794183449,0.010603650685450276,0.17172709407512354,0.13975155279503107

While the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown, the cosmic inflation equation indicates that it must have a minimum diameter of 23 trillion light years, and it is possible to measure the size of the observable universe, which is approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter at the present day.

The Moving Target introduces the detective Lew Archer, who was eventually to figure in a further seventeen novels. Up to this point Macdonald had been writing under the name Kenneth Millar, but adopted the pseudonym John Macdonald for this one. His first drafts were begun in 1947, using the working title of The Snatch; its style was meant to be a refinement on hardboiled fiction, featuring a successor to Philip Marlowe. Macdonald's publisher was dissatisfied with the quality of the writing when it was first submitted and only accepted it after considerable revisions and a change of title. The new title derived from a conversation that Archer has in the novel with a young woman who describes the craving for excitement and risk-taking of her post-war generation as being like driving fast in hope of meeting ""something utterly new.

738,"Tytthus is a genus of insects in family Miridae, the plant bugs. They are carnivorous, feeding upon the eggs of various planthoppers in the family Delphacidae, and thus are important in the biological control of pests. The genus is distributed throughout the Holarctic of the Northern Hemisphere, but species are also found in the tropics, in China, South America, Australia, and the Indo-Pacific. Type species
In 1860 Gustav Flor described a bug he found in Estonia and named it Capsus geminus. When Fieber established the genus Tytthus in 1864, he named two species to the genus, Zetterstedt's Capus pygmaeus and Flor's Capus geminus. Capus geminus thus became Tytthus geminus, by which name it was known as for well over a hundred years. In 1906 Kirkaldy named then Tytthus geminus as the type species for the genus. But, as Henry and Wheeler discovered in 1988, the name Capsus geminus was not available in 1860, because Thomas Say had already used it 1832 for another species entirely. So, after researching the various previous nomenclaturial acts regarding the bug, they discovered that the next available name was one used by Harry H. Knight in 1931 to describe the same bug as if it were a new species, but placing it in the genus Cyrtorhinus Fieber, 1858 as Reuter had made Tytthus a junior synonym of Cyrtorhinus. Knight's name, Cyrtorhinus pubescens was the oldest junior synonym. In 1992, Wheeler and Henry published a treatise reviewing the Miridae family occurring in the Holarctic, and formally corrected the nomenclaturial error in accordance with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, with the result that the type species was henceforth called Tytthus pubescens (Knight, 1931).",0.0,1.4332129963898916,6.394285714285714,25.181818181818183,0.36101083032490977,0.026499302649930265,-69.1142857142857,57.67928571428571,62.28571428571429,17.911571428571428,179.97256515775038,0.8708163405520406,0.023075012993674367,0.9254901960784314,0.9140625000000016,0.018064160815090182,0.1708778684306367,0.09131205673758865

The new dedication waltz was to celebrate the wedding of the Emperor Franz Joseph I's daughter Archduchess Gisela Louise Maria and Prince Leopold of Bavaria. However, the waltz was also chiefly noted by Strauss' biographers as the début of Strauss with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra where for many years, the Philharmonic had dismissed any association with the 'Waltz King' as it had not wished to be associated with mere 'light' or 'pops' music. The festival ball celebrating the event was held at the Musikverein Hall which is the venue for the present day Neujahrskonzert.

A proposition is an assertion about the truth of some property or event. The function can be defined in terms of a set of atomic propositions, which are statements that express a single element or quality. For example, the propositional function 'p' could represent the statement ""the sun rises"", while 'not p' could represent the statement ""the sun does not rise"". 
 
The syntax of a proposition is usually expressed in terms of a set of atomic propositions, which are combined using logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT.

752,"The Carracci  were a Bolognese family of artists that played an instrumental role in bringing forth the Baroque style in painting. Brothers Annibale (1560–1609) and Agostino (1557–1602) along with their cousin Ludovico (1555–1619) worked collaboratively. The Carracci family left their legacy in art theory by starting a school for artists in 1582. The school was called the Accademia degli Incamminati, and its main focus was to oppose and challenge Mannerist artistic practices and principles in order to create a renewed art of naturalism and expressive persuasion. Art theory
The artistic and theoretical activity of the Carracci is recognized by critics and historians such as André Chastel and Giulio Carlo Argan to have decisively contributed to the formation of the figurative Baroque and to new pictorial solutions based on the recuperation of the classical and Renaissance tradition, renewed by study of nature.

757,"Robert Latzel (28 October 1845 – 15 December 1919) was an Austrian myriapodologist and entomologist who published a series of pioneering works on millipedes, centipedes, and allies. His collection of myriapod specimens, today housed in the Natural History Museum of Vienna, includes many type specimens. His monographs on the myriapods of the Austro-Hungarian Empire were the first comprehensive treatments of the large region's centipede and millipede faunas. He named nearly 130 taxa of millipedes (1 genus, 2 subgenera, 69 species and 56 variations) and over 40 centipede groups (2 genera, 29 species and 12 variations), as well as four taxa each of pauropods and symphylans. His work on millipedes pioneered the use of gonopods in millipede classification and species recognition. At least three authors have honored Latzel by naming a genus Latzelia (Scudder 1890, Bollman 1893, Verhoeff, 1895).

758,"Albert ""Ginger"" Goodwin  (May 10, 1887–July 27, 1918), nicknamed Ginger for his bright red hair, was a migrant coal miner who advocated for workers' rights and promoted the cause of unions in British Columbia, Canada. Angered by the working conditions in coal mines, Goodwin sought to increase wages and improve working conditions, and fought companies that disregarded workers' rights. He participated in and led multiple strikes, and served as a delegate for the British Columbia Federation of Labour and as an organizer for the Socialist Party of Canada. In the years following his increased activism and involvement with labour unions, Goodwin fell under scrutiny for his opposition to military conscription during World War I. He was killed by a police officer in 1918. There is debate on whether Goodwin was a victim of murder or if his death was the result of the officer's self-defence. His death sparked a one-day general strike in Vancouver on August 2, 1918, which was the first general strike ever held in Canada. The strike was a precursor of the Winnipeg general strike of 1919 and other labour conflicts. Early life and radicalization

The process of healing can be influenced by various factors such as genetics, environment, lifestyle, and medical treatment. For example, if a person has a genetic predisposition to certain diseases or conditions, their risk of developing them may increase. Similarly, environmental factors such as pollution, stress, and trauma can also impact the body's ability to heal. Lifestyle choices such as diet, exercise, and mental health can also play a role in promoting healing. Additionally, medical treatments such as surgery, radiation therapy, and medication can affect the body's ability to recover.

781,"Figure-ground contrast, in the context of map design, is a property of a map in which the map image can be partitioned into a single feature or type of feature that is considered as an object of attention (the figure), with the remainder of the map being relegated to the background, outside the current focus of attention. It is thus based on the concept of figure–ground from Gestalt psychology. For example, in a street map with strong figure-ground contrast, the reader would be able to isolate and focus attention on individual features, like a given street, park, or lake, as well as layers of related features, like the street network. Strong figure-ground contrast has been seen as a desirable goal of map design, because it helps the map reader to perceive distinct geographic phenomena in the map. This allows more complex composition techniques such as visual hierarchy to organize these phenomena into clear structures that help readers use the map for its intended purposes.",0.0,1.3170731707317074,6.634408602150538,32.8,0.43902439024390244,0.02063106796116505,-89.84727272727272,66.78181818181818,72.54545454545455,16.892439393939394,164.33670434265315,0.89086544649138,0.021399492526548596,0.9266666666666667,0.9244444444444442,0.016534490498279215,0.16735857291307216,0.13839285714285715

783,"Carolina Oliphant, Lady Nairne (16 August 1766 – 26 October 1845) – also known as Carolina Baroness Nairn in the peerage of Scotland and Baroness Keith in that of the United Kingdom – was a Scottish songwriter.
Many of her songs, such as, ""Will ye no' come back again?"", ""Charlie is my Darling"" , ""The Rowan Tree"" and ""Wi' a Hundred Pipers' remain popular today, almost two hundred years after they were written. One of her songs, ""Caller Herrin'"", was sung at the 2021 commemoration of the 1881 Eyemouth disaster. She usually set her words to traditional Scottish folk melodies, but sometimes contributed her own music. Carolina Nairne and her contemporary Robert Burns were influenced by the Jacobite heritage in their establishment of a distinct Scottish identity, through what they both called national song. Perhaps in the belief that her work would not be taken seriously if it were known that she was a woman, Nairne went to considerable lengths to conceal her identity (even from her husband) when submitting her work for publication. Early on she called herself Mrs Bogan of Bogan, but feeling that gave too much away she often attributed her songs to the gender-neutral B.B., S.M., or ""Unknown"".",0.0,1.3990147783251232,5.7984496124031,25.375,0.3681592039800995,0.040674603174603176,-20.295999999999978,40.93300000000001,44.400000000000006,14.35985,82.89935168455733,0.9269045929388835,0.013875735612842218,0.9611111111111112,0.9522222222222236,0.008332888200416645,0.18875255871522326,0.09236453201970443

785,"In visual physiology, adaptation is the ability of the retina of the eye to adjust to various levels of light. Natural night vision, or scotopic vision, is the ability to see under low-light conditions. In humans, rod cells are exclusively responsible for night vision as cone cells are only able to function at higher illumination levels. Night vision is of lower quality than day vision because it is limited in resolution and colors cannot be discerned; only shades of gray are seen.  In order for humans to transition from day to night vision they must undergo a dark adaptation period of up to two hours in which each eye adjusts from a high to a low luminescence ""setting"", increasing sensitivity hugely, by many orders of magnitude.  This adaptation period is different between rod and cone cells and results from the regeneration of photopigments to increase retinal sensitivity. Light adaptation, in contrast, works very quickly, within seconds. Efficiency 
The human eye can function from very dark to very bright levels of light; its sensing capabilities reach across nine orders of magnitude. This means that the brightest and the darkest light signal that the eye can sense are a factor of roughly 1,000,000,000 apart. However, in any given moment of time, the eye can only sense a contrast ratio of 1,000. What enables the wider reach is that the eye adapts its definition of what is black.",0.0,1.446808510638298,6.226950354609929,21.363636363636363,0.39148936170212767,0.025684931506849314,-48.26001046025101,49.677761506276156,53.825104602510464,15.443658158995815,131.1499567131463,0.8872221225641712,0.02068924635122637,0.937777777777778,0.9360730593607324,0.013171525825070297,0.17357322728419253,0.1375

799,"The Order of Monfragüe  was a Spanish military order founded at the castle of Monfragüe near Plasencia on the Tagus in 1196. The order was founded by the knights of the Order of Mountjoy who dissented from a merger with the Knights Templar. The order never prospered and on 23 May 1221, by order of Ferdinand III of Castile, it was merged into the Order of Calatrava. Formation
In the twelfth century Monfragüe was the centre of a Mountjoy commandary before it became the headquarters of its own order. The earliest reference to the commandary is in an economic transaction involving the commander, Gonzalo Padilla, and his fellow brothers (freyes, freires) of the Order. As early as 1186 the Order had tried to amalgamate with the Templars but failed. The remaining decade of its existence was spent in a state of utter collapse. The Order was united in December 1187 with the Hospital of the Holy Redeemer, but already a distinction had appeared in its ranks between the master of the order, Fralmo, and his followers on one hand and the commander of the Order in the Kingdom of Castile, Rodrigo González, and his support. By mid-1188 there was a schism in the Order, though it does not appear to have broken down along the lines Castile and León on one hand and the Crown of Aragon on the other, as sometimes supposed.

807,"The Salary Grab Act, officially known as the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Expenses Appropriation Act, was passed by the United States Congress on March 3, 1873 and sparked a firestorm of controversy among members of the government, the general public, and the press. President Ulysses S. Grant signed the act the day before his inauguration for a second term to double the salary of the president and those of Supreme Court Justices. The proposal for a salary increase was fueled by what was considered low pay for members in government, while the salary for the president was the same as it had been for George Washington. The bill subsequently included a 50 percent salary increase for the president and for members of Congress, retroactive to the beginning of their term, which was the most highly contested provision in the bill. Public outcry led Congress to rescind the congressional salary increase. As a protest against the act, Ohio ratified what later became the Twenty-seventh Amendment.

810,"Supported employment refers to service provisions wherein people with disabilities, including intellectual disabilities, mental health, and traumatic brain injury, among others, are assisted with obtaining and maintaining employment. Supported employment is considered to be one form of employment in which wages are expected, together with benefits from an employer in a competitive workplace, though some versions refer to disability agency paid employment. Companies such as Skilcraft in the United States are an example of ""supported employment"" which is defined in law for state and federal reimbursements (by person not by agency or corporation). Community foundations of supported employment
Supported employment was developed in the United States in the 1970s as part of both vocational rehabilitation (VR) services (e.g., NYS Office of Vocational Services, 1978) and the advocacy for long term services and supports (LTSS) for individuals with significant disabilities in competitive job placements in integrated settings (e.g., businesses, offices, manufacturing facilities). Since the mid-1980s, supported employment in the professional literature primarily has referred to the ""individual placement"" model, either with job coaches or through ""natural supports"" models. The critical issue in supported employment (SE) was viewed as the need for funding for long-term services and supports (LTSS) in the community often termed beyond ""case closure"" (Griffin, Test, Dalton, & Wood, 1995). Supported employment is worldwide in 2013, though moving to new inclusive models, and the term has been used for assisting workers of diverse kinds who may need an extra jump start in the workplace; it is still associated with its roots in disability which includes community integration and deinstitutionalization",0.0,1.5923076923076922,7.264367816091954,37.142857142857146,0.3667953667953668,0.025096525096525095,-82.18112068965513,57.141781609195405,63.234482758620686,17.79255670498084,112.67351721651343,0.9047212471144234,0.01715819310918351,0.9450980392156862,0.9442622950819677,0.01131119355714415,0.1935550189709712,0.1331417624521073
811,"Judicial murder is the intentional and premeditated killing of an innocent person by means of capital punishment; therefore, it is a subset of wrongful execution. The Oxford English Dictionary describes it as ""death inflicted by process of law, capital punishment, esp. considered to be unjust or cruel"". Example
An early case in which charges of judicial murder were raised was the Amboyna massacre in 1623, which caused a legal dispute between the English and Dutch governments over the conduct of a court in the Dutch East Indies that had ordered the execution of ten English men accused of treason. The dispute centered around differing interpretations of the legal jurisdiction of the court in question. The English believed that this court had not been competent to try and execute these EIC members, and so believed the executions to have been fundamentally illegal, thus constituting ""judicial murder"". The Dutch, on the other hand, believed the court to have been fundamentally competent, and wished to focus instead on misconduct of the particular judges in the court.",0.0,1.4046242774566473,6.764705882352941,24.714285714285715,0.3815028901734104,0.023153252480705624,-14.953251445086664,36.834017341040465,42.692485549132954,13.859558959537571,183.20713899405084,0.8926905839011585,0.02084692204765048,0.9272727272727274,0.9210970464135018,0.018427852577179382,0.16802283003016877,0.1192528735632184

815,"Ali Qapu Palace (, ‘Ālī Qāpū) or the Grand Ālī Qāpū is an imperial palace in Isfahan, Iran. It is located on the western side of the Naqsh-e Jahan Square, opposite to Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque, and had been originally designed as a vast portal entrance to the grand palace which stretched from the Naqsh-e Jahan Square to the Chahar Baq Boulevard. The palace served as the official residence of Persian Emperors of the Safavid dynasty. UNESCO inscribed the Palace and the Square as a World Heritage Site due to its cultural and historical importance. The palace is forty-eight meters high and there are  six floors, each accessible by a difficult spiral staircase. In the sixth floor, Music Hall, deep circular niches are found in the walls, having not only aesthetic value, but also acoustic. Ālī Qāpū is regarded as the best example of Safavid architecture and a symbol of Iran's Islamic heritage. The name Ali Qapu, from Persian ‘Ālī (meaning ""imperial"" or ""great""), and Azerbaijani Qāpū (meaning ""gate""), was given to this place as it was right at the entrance to the Safavid palaces which stretched from the Naqsh-e Jahan Square to the Chahar Baq Boulevard.
The building, another wonderful Safavid edifice, was built by decree of Shah Abbas I in the early seventeenth century. It was here that the great monarch used to entertain noble visitors, and foreign ambassadors.

818,"Egernia is a genus of skinks (family Scincidae) that occurs in Australia. These skinks are ecologically diverse omnivores that inhabit a wide range of habitats. However, in the loose delimitation (which incorporates about 30 species) the genus is not monophyletic but an evolutionary grade, as has long been suspected due to its lack of characteristic apomorphies. Some of the skinks traditionally placed in Egernia appear to be among the most intelligent squamates. They have been shown to be able to distinguish between relatives and unrelated conspecifics, and can recognize relatives individually. Several species form monogamous pair-bonds. For instance, the Black Rock Skink is a species who can perform kin discrimination based on scent and form monogamous pair-bonds and a nuclear family structure. Most of these species belong to Egernia sensu stricto, and similar behaviour is also known in the related Solomon Islands skink (Corucia zebrata). The latter means that the high intelligence and social skills are probably plesiomorphic for the Egernia genus-group as a whole, and that the solitary species appear to have evolved towards being less intelligent and social again. It may still be, however, that the intelligent behaviour is a homoplasy that evolved several times in the Egernia genus-group; the fact that Corucia is a monotypic and rather distinct genus makes it impossible to decide at present.",0.0,1.547945205479452,7.091603053435114,21.9,0.3972602739726027,0.015859766277128547,-169.5842465753424,91.3186301369863,95.81917808219178,20.987941095890413,112.36427910108576,0.9011114704980966,0.018365423006011745,0.9428571428571431,0.9483660130718964,0.01128820868388788,0.17144390943548352,0.11995515695067265

827,"""Tiburón"" (Spanish: Shark) is a salsa song by Rubén Blades and Willie Colón which appeared on their 1981 album Canciones del Solar de los Aburridos. The song is a metaphor for American intervention in Latin America, with the titular shark representing the influence of American imperialism in the region. Throughout the second half of the song, the singers shout the phrase, ""si lo ven que viene, ¡palo al tiburón!"" (""If you see him coming, [bring a] stick to the shark!"") Reception 
Music critic Dave Marsh listed ""Tiburón"" as one of his top 20 political songs written after 1976, calling it ""the original anti-Central America invasion protest."" At the time of its release, American radios played the song infrequently, and it was heavily unpopular among the Cuban community in Miami. In a 1991 interview, Colón said that politically charged songs like ""Tiburón"" and ""Pedro Navaja"" were so controversial that he and Blades occasionally performed them in bulletproof vests.",0.0,1.4713375796178343,5.605042016806722,22.428571428571427,0.33121019108280253,0.037943696450428395,-8.633582802547764,33.96512738853504,37.005095541401275,15.173666878980892,111.92276474860097,0.9362068024504567,0.012681440174076368,0.9400000000000001,0.9405275779376508,0.011265909872721018,0.1983204905157146,0.09748427672955974

829,"Cirquent calculus is a proof calculus that manipulates graph-style constructs termed cirquents, as opposed to the traditional tree-style objects such as formulas or sequents. Cirquents come in a variety of forms, but they all share one main characteristic feature, making them different from the more traditional objects of syntactic manipulation. This feature is the ability to explicitly account for possible sharing of subcomponents between different components. For instance, it is possible to write an expression where two subexpressions F and E, while neither one is a subexpression of the other, still have a common occurrence of a subexpression G (as opposed to having two different occurrences of G, one in F and one in E). Overview
The approach was introduced by G. Japaridze in  as an alternative proof theory capable of “taming” various nontrivial fragments of his computability logic, which had otherwise resisted all axiomatization attempts within the traditional proof-theoretic frameworks. The origin of the term “cirquent” is CIRcuit+seQUENT, as the simplest form of cirquents, while resembling circuits rather than formulas, can be thought of as collections of one-sided sequents (for instance, sequents of a given level of a Gentzen-style proof tree) where some sequents may have shared elements.

832,"The Woman's Tribune was an American newspaper founded in Beatrice, Nebraska, by women's suffrage activist Clara Bewick Colby. In print from 1883 to 1909, and published in Beatrice and in Washington, D.C., the newspaper connected radical feminism with women's culture on the Midwestern frontier. Throughout its run, its slogan was ""Equality Before the Law.""  Unlike other suffrage papers that focused on urban culture and politics, The Woman's Tribune'''s appeal to the rural and everyday woman made it one of the most powerful voices of feminist ideology during its day. Colby routinely included generalist news, suffrage news, book reviews, travelogues, editorials, and even poetry in the paper. Some stories and features were intended to be read to children, presumably by their mothers, making the Tribune unusual in its explicitly multi-generational audience. Despite lack of financial support from national suffrage organizations, Colby managed to keep the Tribune in production for its 26 years; she wrote, edited, copyedited, and even at times typeset the paper. Advertising focused on products and services provided by and for women. Notices of events in the international suffragist community appeared as well, connecting women on the American frontier to women's suffrage campaigns in Europe and Asia. Colby met and corresponded with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony; she frequently published their work in the Tribune although she received little, if any, financial support from their political orgazniation. Bloomberg has argued that the Woman's Tribune'' was unique among women's suffrage publications in that it argued for full equality under the law for Native and indigenous people (women and men); the core audience of the paper, however, like its founding editor, was in the white, literate middle-class.

Cleanliness is often achieved through cleaning. Culturally, cleanliness is usually a good quality, as indicated by the aphorism: ""Cleanliness is next to Godliness"", and may be regarded as contributing to other ideals such as health and beauty. In emphasizing an ongoing procedure or set of habits for the purpose of maintenance and prevention, the concept of cleanliness differs from purity, which is a physical, moral, or ritual state of freedom from pollutants.

837,"A brass quintet is a five-piece musical ensemble composed of brass instruments. The instrumentation for a brass quintet typically includes two trumpets or cornets, one French horn, one trombone or euphonium/baritone horn, and one tuba or bass trombone. Musicians in a brass quintet may often play multiple instruments. Trumpet players for instance may double on piccolo trumpets and flugelhorns. There can be variation in instrumentation depending on the type of quintet. In some quintets, the horn is replaced by an additional trombone. Euphonium may also be substituted for the trombone part. While the tuba is considered a standard, the range and style of many pieces lend themselves to being played with bass trombone as the lowest-pitched instrument. Additionally, some pieces call for the use of percussion instruments, particularly the snare drum, tambourine, or timpani. History 
The earliest brass chamber music was written in the mid to late 1800s and coincided with the invention of brass instruments that could play chromatically. The Distin family formed one of the first brass quintets in 1833, touring Europe and the United States to promote a new family of brass instruments called saxhorns.

845,"Hurricane Emily in 1993 caused record flooding in the Outer Banks of North Carolina while remaining just offshore. The fifth named storm and the first yet strongest hurricane of the year's hurricane season, Emily developed from a tropical wave northeast of the Lesser Antilles on August 22, 1993. It moved northwestward and strengthened into a tropical storm on August 25, after becoming nearly stationary southeast of Bermuda. Emily then curved to the southwest but quickly resumed its northwest trajectory while strengthening into a hurricane. Late on August 31, the hurricane reached peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) on its approach to North Carolina. Although part of the eye passed over Hatteras Island in the Outer Banks, its absolute center remained 23 mi (37 km/h) offshore. Gradually weakening, the hurricane swerved away from the coast toward the northeast and later east. Emily stalled again, this time northeast of Bermuda, and dissipated on September 6 to the southeast of Newfoundland. The threat of Emily prompted hurricane warnings for much of the North Carolina coast and northward through Delaware. A mandatory evacuation for Ocracoke and Hatteras islands displaced 160,000 people during the busy Labor Day weekend; the loss in tourism revenue amounted to $10 million (1993 USD). About 1,600 residents on these islands rode out the storm in their homes, and emergency officials stayed behind. Most of the evacuees went to hotels or stayed with friends or relatives, causing an increase in business across southeastern Virginia, where effects were minimal.

869,"Hurricane Patricia was the strongest tropical cyclone on record worldwide in terms of wind speed and the second-most intense on record worldwide in terms of pressure, behind Typhoon Tip in 1979, with a minimum atmospheric pressure of 872 mbar (hPa; ). Originating from a sprawling disturbance near the Gulf of Tehuantepec, south of Mexico, in mid-October 2015, Patricia was first classified a tropical depression on October 20. Initial development was slow, with only modest strengthening within the first day of its classification. The system later became a tropical storm and was named Patricia, the twenty-fourth named storm of the annual hurricane season. Exceptionally favorable environmental conditions fueled explosive intensification on October 22. A well-defined eye developed within an intense central dense overcast and Patricia grew from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in just 24 hours—a near-record pace. On October 23, the hurricane achieved its record peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 215 mph (345 km/h). This made it the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Western Hemisphere and the strongest globally in terms of one-minute maximum sustained winds. Late on October 23, dramatic weakening ensued and Patricia made landfall near Cuixmala, Jalisco, with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h). This still made it the strongest landfalling Pacific hurricane on record. Patricia continued to weaken extremely quickly, faster than it had intensified, as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of Mexico. Within 24 hours of moving ashore, Patricia weakened into a tropical depression and dissipated soon thereafter, late on October 24.",0.0,1.52734375,6.744318181818182,21.333333333333332,0.30196078431372547,0.019525801952580194,-198.00244186046504,104.97108527131783,110.95193798449614,24.450703100775193,126.69899597022062,0.8839652599441992,0.021139744308421502,0.9666666666666667,0.9494152046783634,0.012722471794520079,0.17229280472154873,0.11552346570397112

876,"In propositional calculus, a propositional function or a predicate is a sentence expressed in a way that would assume the value of true or false, except that within the sentence there is a variable (x) that is not defined or specified (thus being a free variable), which leaves the statement undetermined. The sentence may contain several such variables (e.g. n variables, in which case the function takes n arguments). Overview
As a mathematical function, A(x) or A(x, x, ..., x), the propositional function is abstracted from predicates or propositional forms.  As an example, consider the predicate scheme, ""x is hot"".  The substitution of any entity for x will produce a specific proposition that can be described as either true or false, even though ""x is hot"" on its own has no value as either a true or false statement.  However, when a value is assigned to x , such as lava, the function then has the value true; while one assigns to x a value like ice, the function then has the value false.",0.0,1.367816091954023,5.752380952380952,24.857142857142858,0.42441860465116277,0.03878787878787879,-3.8014999999999617,35.527,41.62857142857143,13.480442857142858,206.36734693877554,0.8646840626509027,0.026199718252081283,0.8787878787878788,0.9031055900621122,0.020755336617405584,0.21251638701293288,0.11789772727272727

881," function theorem states that if a function f(x) is continuous and differentiable on an open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one function g(x) such that f(g(x)) = x for all x in (a, b). This theorem has many applications in various fields of mathematics, including calculus, optimization, and physics. The concept of inverse functions is important in many areas of science and engineering, as it allows us to solve problems where the original function is not known or cannot be found explicitly. Inverse functions are also used in computer graphics to create realistic animations and in image processing to enhance images.",1.0,1.4903846153846154,6.107692307692307,26.0,0.4174757281553398,0.020754716981132074,-32.22794392523363,44.33626168224299,49.52897196261682,16.46977476635514,92.58450519696042,0.9267904932334273,0.015667063648181545,0.9428571428571428,0.9426523297491034,0.009345794392523364,0.19155886573410524,0.1391509433962264

888,"The Vanishing Lady (, literally ""Magical Disappearance of a Lady at the Théâtre Robert-Houdin"") is an 1896 French short silent trick film directed by Georges Méliès. It features Méliès and Jehanne d'Alcy performing a trick in the manner of a stage illusion, in which D'Alcy disappears into thin air. A skeleton appears in her place before she finally returns for a curtain call.  The film, shot outdoors in Méliès's garden on a platform decorated with theatrical scenery, is based on a famous stage illusion by Buatier de Kolta, in which a woman disappeared by escaping through a hidden trapdoor. However, using an editing technique known as the substitution splice, Méliès carried out the trick using cinematic special effects rather than conventional stage machinery. The substitution splice also allowed Méliès to add new material to the end of the trick, inventing the appearance and transformation of the skeleton prop and d'Alcy's return. The film, notable as Méliès's first known use of cinematic special effects, survives in film archives; a hand-colored version has also been reconstructed by a Méliès scholar.",0.0,1.4101123595505618,6.344262295081967,25.428571428571427,0.3220338983050847,0.02763018065887354,-113.90016393442619,74.60841530054645,80.41311475409837,19.270895628415303,131.02282333051562,0.9032425683589541,0.018592872273074774,0.9055555555555556,0.9285714285714289,0.01317467063323417,0.16491983266978524,0.12021857923497266

902,"Political jurisprudence is a legal theory that some judicial decisions are motivated more by politics than by unbiased judgment. According to Professor Martin Shapiro of University of California, Berkeley, who first noted the theory in 1964: ""The core of  political jurisprudence is a vision of courts as political agencies and judges as political actors."" Legal decisions are no longer focused on a judge's analytical analysis (as in Analytical jurisprudence), but rather it is the judges themselves that become the focus for determining how the decision was reached. Political jurisprudence advocates that judges are not machines but are influenced and swayed by the political system and by their own personal beliefs of how the law should be decided. That is not to say necessarily that judges arbitrarily make decisions they personally feel should be right without regard to stare decisis. Instead they are making decisions based on their political, legal, and personal beliefs as it relates to the law. Deeply, and with more implication for the society, the decisions of the judges are not only modified from the politics, but modify itself the politics and the process of law making in a so influential way, that we can say that the policy-making is ""judicialized"". Shapiro noted political jurisprudence as having two wings, the macro wing and the micro wing. The macro wing looks at courts as players in the political process. In their processes of decision making, they entertain matters from different interest groups hence shape policy through pressure from these. the micro wing looks at individual decisions of judges. The second wing is a manifestation of Charles H. Pritchett who introduced behaviorism into USA judicial studies after studies that showed individual decisions in courts have been increasing since the days of President Roosevelt.",0.0,1.5255972696245734,6.927710843373494,24.416666666666668,0.4197952218430034,0.019157088122605363,-237.75459183673465,119.45911564625851,126.17142857142858,25.147165306122446,131.16052603990727,0.879764158193225,0.02116763874673545,0.9263157894736843,0.9151732377538846,0.01316097059236056,0.168025562876446,0.1241554054054054

It was first published in the collection of poems titled Poems (1864), and has since been anthologized numerous times, including in The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson (1974). The poem is one of Dickinson's most famous works, and is often interpreted as a meditation on the nature of God or the divine. In it, she describes the idea that ""the divine image"" is present in all human beings, regardless of their social status or position in society. This concept is conveyed through Dickinson's use of language, imagery, and symbolism. The poem is written in blank verse, with no regular rhyme scheme or meter, which adds to its unique and unconventional style.

909,"A secretory protein is any protein, whether it be endocrine or exocrine, which is secreted by a cell. Secretory proteins include many hormones, enzymes, toxins, and antimicrobial peptides.
Secretory proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Production
The production of a secretory protein starts like any other protein. The mRNA is produced and transported to the cytosol where it interacts with a free cytosolic ribosome. The part that is produced first, the N-terminal, contains a signal sequence consisting of 6 to 12 amino acids with hydrophobic side chains. This sequence is recognised by a cytosolic protein, SRP (Signal Recognition Particle), which stops the translation and aids in the transport of the mRNA-ribosome complex to an SRP receptor found in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. When it arrives at the ER, the signal sequence is transferred to the translocon, a protein-conducting channel in the membrane that allows the newly synthesized polypeptide to be translocated to the ER lumen. The dissociation of SRP from the ribosome restores the translation of the secretory protein. The signal sequence is removed and the translation continues while the produced chain moves through the translocon (cotranslational translocation).",0.0,1.5549738219895288,7.580357142857143,19.1,0.41361256544502617,0.01948051948051948,-2.18247818499124,29.38031413612565,35.72844677137871,14.813371902268763,251.39273816522496,0.8747021680935517,0.02390383044936453,0.8722222222222223,0.8895238095238092,0.02527299335809974,0.1971871932537279,0.125

912,"The Bendidia was an ancient Athenian festival celebrating the Thracian goddess Bendis.  It was celebrated on the 19th day of the month of Thargelion (late May, in the Gregorian calendar), and was introduced in 429 BC.  The festival took place in the Piraeus.  It was rare for ancient Athens to permit foreign residents of the city to worship their own gods; the cult of Bendis and the Bendidia is one of a few exceptions, driven by the strategic importance of Thrace to Athens at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War. The Bendidia began with a procession to the sanctuary of Bendis.  Worshippers coming from Athens processed from the Prytaneion, while the Thracian worshippers of Bendis in the Piraeus organised a separate procession, possibly organised so that it would join up with the Athenian contingent before they arrived at the sanctuary.  The procession from Athens – six miles from the sanctuary – was provided with sponges and basins in which to wash, and garlands; the celebrants then ate lunch in the precinct of the sanctuary.  After dark, there was a horseback relay race, with the riders passing torches.  The horseback race was a Thracian feature of the festival, as such races at Athenian festivals were usually performed on foot, and Thracians were famous for their equestrianism, though it is unknown if similar races were also held in Thrace itself.  The horse race was followed by an all-night celebration, though the precise details of the remainder of the festival are unknown.",0.0,1.3132530120481927,6.632352941176471,24.9,0.41365461847389556,0.019261637239165328,-172.65380566801616,98.70275303643724,105.27773279352228,21.577214170040484,241.5890012558662,0.8813329828097074,0.02155492660446935,0.8833333333333334,0.8890804597701156,0.024257507881201262,0.1762721097981759,0.099609375

915,"The Daytona 100 was a USAC Championship Car race held at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida on Saturday April 4, 1959. It was the first and only Indy car race held on the high banks of Daytona, and saw incredible speeds turned in by the front-engined ""roadsters."" The race was part of a triple-header weekend featuring races for the USAC Championship Cars, Formula Libre, and a USAC-FIA sports car endurance race. Both the Champ Car and Formula Libre races were won by Jim Rathmann. However, the weekend was marred by the tragic death of George Amick, who was killed in a crash on the final lap of the Champ Car race. Amick's death came less than two months after Marshall Teague was also killed testing a highly modified Indy roadster at the track. Despite a predicted crowd of over 30,000 spectators for the weekend, turnout was disappointing. With estimates as low as 7,000 to 10,000 in attendance for Saturday, the event was also seen as unsuccessful and a money-loser. In the wake of the tragic circumstances, the blindingly fast speeds were deemed too dangerous for the track, and the Indy cars would never again race on the Daytona International Speedway oval.

920,"Israel (Yisrol) Grodner (; ca. 1848 – 1887) was one of the founding performers in Yiddish theater. A Lithuanian Jew who moved at the age of 16 to Berdichev, Ukraine, Russian Empire, the Broder singer and actor was in Iaşi, Romania in 1876 when Abraham Goldfaden recruited him as the first actor for what became the first professional Yiddish theater troupe. Jacob Adler remarks that as the only Lithuanian Jew in the early years of Yiddish theater, he deliberately spoke a different dialect of Yiddish on stage so that it would blend better with the other actors. (The Yiddish of Lithuania differed from that of Ukraine and Romania.) Although his early performances with Goldfaden are usually considered the start of professional Yiddish-language theater, as a Broder singer Grodner was already something of an actor, and he had already participated in an 1873 concert in Odessa, Ukraine in which he and other Broder singers sang songs (including some of Goldfaden's) and improvised comic material between songs that was very similar to Goldfaden's early, highly improvised, comic musical plays. Actor Jacob Adler, already a big fan of the highly regarded Russian language theater in Odessa at that time, and who saw Grodner perform in taverns and restaurants, indicates in his memoir the strong impression Grodner made on him for how well he portrayed his characters.

928,"Mass amateurization refers to the capabilities that new forms of media have given to non-professionals and the ways in which those non-professionals have applied those capabilities to solve problems (e.g. create and distribute content) that compete with the solutions offered by larger, professional institutions. Mass amateurization is most often associated with Web 2.0 technologies. These technologies include the rise of blogs and citizen journalism, photo and video-sharing services such as Flickr and YouTube, user-generated wikis like Wikipedia, and distributed accommodation services such as Airbnb. While the social web is not the only technology responsible for the rise of mass amateurization, Clay Shirky claims Web 2.0 has allowed amateurs to undertake increasingly complex tasks resulting in accomplishments that would seem daunting within the traditional institutional model. In addition to whole websites and applications, Web 2.0 has also birthed a variety of digital tools that facilitate organization and problem solving on a large scale. These tools include tags, trackbacks, and hashtags. These new forms of media became widely available during the first decade of the 21st century due in part to the fall of transactional costs of creating and distributing media.

Kolderup Rosenvinge og W. Johannsen. He took his Ph.D. from the same university in 1930. From 1934 to 1960, he was superintendent at the Botanical Museum of the University of Copenhagen. Hagerup’s scientific works concern evolution, polyploidy and pollination, among other things. He showed that the tetraploid Empetrum hermaphroditum is a separate species from the diploid Empetrum nigrum. He thereby initiated the use of chromosome numbers in systematic botany, a field later known as cytotaxonomy. He put forward the hypothesis that the ploidy level is an important factor in the distribution and ecology of plant species. In contrast, another of his scientific ideas has been disproven by later modern research – the idea of a direct ancestry of the centrosperms (approximately equal to Caryophyllales) from the gymnospermous Gnetophyta and, hence, two separate evolutionary lineages within the flowering plants. Many of Hagerup’s studies were concerned with plant species of the Ericaceae, Empetraceae and related families, or ’’Bicornes’’ as they were known in the Wettstein system.",0.0,1.5765306122448979,6.583333333333333,19.6,0.32653061224489793,0.02389705882352941,-136.98294416243652,81.30598984771574,86.10964467005077,21.18247157360406,143.5557207812634,0.9183562025943683,0.01560736038677845,0.9555555555555557,0.9414258188824667,0.01443275257317003,0.17695064059475202,0.09438775510204082

948,"In cryptography, a timing attack is a side-channel attack in which the attacker attempts to compromise a cryptosystem by analyzing the time taken to execute cryptographic algorithms. Every logical operation in a computer takes time to execute, and the time can differ based on the input; with precise measurements of the time for each operation, an attacker can work backwards to the input. Finding secrets through timing information may be significantly easier than using cryptanalysis of known plaintext, ciphertext pairs. Sometimes timing information is combined with cryptanalysis to increase the rate of information leakage. Information can leak from a system through measurement of the time it takes to respond to certain queries. How much this information can help an attacker depends on many variables: cryptographic system design, the CPU running the system, the algorithms used, assorted implementation details, timing attack countermeasures, the accuracy of the timing measurements, etc. Timing attacks can be applied to any algorithm that has data-dependent timing variation. Removing timing-dependencies is difficult in some algorithms that use low-level operations that frequently exhibit varied execution time.",0.0,1.6348314606741574,7.603603603603603,22.25,0.38764044943820225,0.019083969465648856,-136.3810674157303,76.50191011235955,81.761797752809,19.916760674157302,137.60888776669614,0.8981387016629033,0.019657574915755593,0.9151515151515153,0.9215447154471545,0.01383863391100108,0.16108003483895408,0.1510989010989011

950,"The concept of business process orientation (BPO) is based upon the work of Deming (Walton, 1996), Porter (1985), Davenport and Short (1990), Hammer (1993, 1996 and 1999), Grover et al. (1995), and Coombs and Hull (1996).  This body of work suggests that firms could enhance their overall performance by adopting a “process view” of the organization.  Although many firms have adopted the BPO concept, little to no empirical data existed substantiating its effectiveness in facilitating improved business performance.  McCormack (2000) conducted an empirical study to explore the relationship between BPO and enhanced business performance. The research results showed that BPO is critical in reducing conflict and encouraging greater connectedness within an organization, while improving business performance. Moreover, companies with strong measures of BPO showed better overall business performance. The research also showed that high BPO levels within organizations led to a more positive corporate climate, illustrated through better organizational connectedness and less internal conflict. Another empirical study by Kohlbacher (2009) reveals that BPO is positively associated with customer satisfaction, product quality, delivery speed and time-to-market speed. For a central concept, one that has become something of a Holy Grail for 1990s managers, BPO has remained remarkably hard to pin down.  Its champions argue that it is a new approach to management that replaces the rigid hierarchies of the past (""I report to my boss"") with structures that are much flatter, more cooperative, more process-oriented  (""I report to my customer."").  Many of us have had experience with both types of organization and we know intuitively what BPO feels like.

The two species are the dusky grouse (Dendragapus obscurus) and the sooty grouse (Dendragapus fuliginosus).

These are large grouse that inhabit highland regions of North America and Eurasia. The sooty grouse is found in the Pacific Coast Ranges and Sierra Nevada, and the dusky grouse in the Rocky Mountains.

Hanson was a pioneer in advancing the argument that observation is theory-laden — that observation language and theory language are deeply interwoven — and that historical and contemporary comprehension are similarly deeply interwoven. His single most central intellectual concern was the comprehension and development of a logic of discovery. Work
Hanson's best-known work is Patterns of Discovery (1958), in which he argues that what we see and perceive is not what our senses receive, but is instead filtered sensory information, where the filter is our existing preconceptions – a concept later called a 'thematic framework.' He cited optical illusions such as the famous old Parisienne woman (Patterns of Discovery, p. 11), which can be seen in different ways. Hanson drew a distinction between 'seeing as' and 'seeing that' which became a key idea in evolving theories of perception and meaning. He wanted to formulate a logic explaining how scientific discoveries take place.

1009,"David Greig was the supermarket (initially grocery shop) chain founded by the Greig family of Hornsey, north London. With its headquarters at Atlantic Road, Brixton (and later at Waterloo Road, London) and grocery shops across southern England, it was a rival to the Sainsbury's chain, John and Mary Sainsbury having opened their first grocery shop in Holborn one year earlier. A deep personal rivalry developed between the two families, because of acrimonious feelings about the Greigs' alleged betrayal of a verbal agreement regarding the purchasing of sites for development. The David Greig chain is considered to have been established in 1870, when the wife of a Hornsey cabinet maker of Scots birth opened a small provisions shop at 32 High Street, Hornsey. By 1881 her son David Greig had joined her in the business and described himself as a 'provision dealer' in the census of that year. The business thrived and wishing to expand beyond Hornsey, Greig opened his first shop at 54-58 Atlantic Road, Brixton in 1888, initially ""anchoring"" the nascent Brixton Market, which started in Atlantic Road in the 1870s and was so successful that it spread to Brixton Road before being relocated to Brixton Station Road plus several purpose built covered arcades and finally also Electric Avenue, to reduce congestion and allow further growth. Around 1890 a second shop was opened at nearby Loughborough Junction, near Brixton. This was probably the shop at 232 Coldharbour Lane where a wooden ‘David Greig’ fascia with ‘Brilliant cut’ gilded lettering in the distinctive serif typeface of the chain, was uncovered in 2020.

1017,"Adverse possession, sometimes colloquially described as ""squatter's rights"", is a legal principle in the Anglo-American common law under which a person who does not have legal title to a piece of property—usually land (real property)—may acquire legal ownership based on continuous possession or occupation of the property without the permission (licence) of its legal owner. The possession by a person is not adverse if they are in possession as a tenant or licensee of the legal owner. In general, a property owner has the right to recover possession of their property from unauthorised possessors through legal action such as ejectment. However, in the English common law tradition, courts have long ruled that when someone occupies a piece of property without permission and the property's owner does not exercise their right to recover their property for a significant period of time, not only is the original owner prevented from exercising their right to exclude, but an entirely new title to the property ""springs up"" in the adverse possessor. In effect, the adverse possessor becomes the property's new owner. Over time, legislatures have created statutes of limitations that specify the length of time that owners have to recover possession of their property from adverse possessors. In the United States, for example, these time limits vary widely between individual states, ranging from as low as three years to as long as 40 years.",0.0,1.3695652173913044,6.561151079136691,32.857142857142854,0.40869565217391307,0.02139917695473251,-169.56999999999996,95.29148936170213,102.85106382978725,21.33973404255319,149.56989445375675,0.8704638884466935,0.0237635659070746,0.9244444444444445,0.9302891933028924,0.015021459227467811,0.166819855428234,0.13404255319148936

1024,"In economics, the Edgeworth conjecture is the idea, named after Francis Ysidro Edgeworth, that the core of an economy shrinks to the set of Walrasian equilibria as the number of agents increases to infinity. The core of an economy is a concept from cooperative game theory defined as the set of feasible allocations in an economy that cannot be improved upon by subset of the set of the economy's consumers (a coalition). For general equilibrium economies typically the core is non-empty (there is at least one feasible allocation) but also ""large"" in the sense that there may be a continuum of feasible allocations that satisfy the requirements. The conjecture basically states that if the number of agents is also ""large"" then the only allocations in the core are precisely what a competitive market would produce. As such, the conjecture is seen as providing some game-theoretic foundations for the usual assumption in general equilibrium theory of price taking agents. In particular, it means that in a ""large"" economy people act as if they were price takers, even though theoretically they have all the power to set prices and renegotiate their trades. Hence, the fictitious Walrasian auctioneer of general equilibrium, while strictly speaking completely unrealistic, can be seen as a ""short-cut"" to getting the right answer.",0.0,1.5093457943925233,6.6015625,30.571428571428573,0.43457943925233644,0.022381378692927483,-154.22627906976737,88.18279069767442,95.30232558139535,19.882081395348834,178.25851811790156,0.8867054360872592,0.021095177764612484,0.9095238095238097,0.9283582089552246,0.017909150184742446,0.1865087075136438,0.12899543378995432

1043,"The Cinema of Niger began in the 1940s with the ethnographical documentary of French director Jean Rouch, before growing to become one of the most active national film cultures in Francophone Africa in the 1960s-70s with the work of filmmakers such as Oumarou Ganda, Moustapha Alassane and Gatta Abdourahamne. The industry has slowed somewhat since the 1980s, though films continue to be made in the country, with notable directors of recent decades including Mahamane Bakabe, Inoussa Ousseini, Mariama Hima, Moustapha Diop and Rahmatou Keïta. Unlike neighbouring Nigeria, with its thriving Hausa and English-language film industries, most Nigerien films are made in French with Francophone countries as their major market, whilst action and light entertainment films from Nigeria or dubbed western films fill most Nigerien theatres. 1940s-1950s: Colonial beginnings 
The first Nigerien films were made in the 1940s, when Niger was still under French rule as part of French West Africa. Jean Rouch, a French ethnographic filmmaker, is generally considered 'the father of Nigerien film'. Arriving initially as an engineer in 1941, Rouch remained in Niger after independence, and mentored a generation of Nigerien filmmakers and actors, including Damouré Zika, Moustapha Alassane and Oumarou Ganda. Rouch made his first film in Niger in 1947, with the short documentary Au Pays des Mages Noirs (In the Land of Black Mages), going on to make a number of similar short ethnographic documentaries, such as Les Magiciens de Wanzarbé (1948), Initiation à la danse des possédés (Initiation to the Dance of the Possessed; 1949) and Chasse à l'hippopotame (Hippopotamus Chase; 1950).",0.0,1.517509727626459,6.545454545454546,36.714285714285715,0.3229571984435798,0.02399435426958363,-62.148837209302286,53.97503875968992,57.026356589147284,17.991101550387597,116.8585667640488,0.9031014867007479,0.01751160179428022,0.9458333333333334,0.943933054393307,0.011732229123533472,0.181844602181399,0.0916988416988417

1047," has a band structure in which the energy levels of electrons are quantized and do not depend on their position along the surface. This means that there is no electric charge separation between the interior and exterior of the material, and the material behaves as an insulator on both sides. The concept was first proposed by Klaus von Klitzing in 1985[1] and has since been explored for a variety of materials, including metals, semiconductors, and superconductors.
 2. Topological insulators can exhibit unique electronic properties that distinguish them from other types of materials. For example, they may have zero electrical resistance on one side but non-zero resistance on the other side, depending on the direction of the external electric field. They may also exhibit quantum Hall effect behavior, where the electron density is quantized in a specific range of frequencies. These properties make topological insulators important for electronic devices and spintronics, as well as for fundamental physics research",1.0,1.5414012738853504,7.141304347826087,19.625,0.3885350318471338,0.017321016166281754,-27.55759493670884,36.72886075949367,43.75189873417722,14.050786075949368,97.39854318418315,0.9246571498538889,0.014938825976290886,0.9400000000000001,0.9413711583924351,0.009803100125680772,0.16831453093477927,0.1265625

1049,"Analytical psychology (, sometimes translated as analytic psychology and referred to as Jungian analysis) is a term coined by Carl Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist, to describe research into his new ""empirical science"" of the psyche. It was designed to distinguish it from Freud's psychoanalytic theories as their seven-year collaboration on psychoanalysis was drawing to an end between 1912 and 1913. The evolution of his science is contained in his monumental opus, the Collected Works, written over sixty years of his lifetime. The history of analytical psychology is intimately linked with the biography of Jung. At the start, it was known as the ""Zurich school"", whose chief figures were Eugen Bleuler, Franz Riklin, Alphonse Maeder and Jung, all centred in the Burghölzli hospital in Zurich.

This means that the person can claim title to the property as their own, even if they did not pay rent or have any documents proving ownership. Adverse possession is most commonly found in common law countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia, but it has been abolished in some states of India. The concept of adverse possession originated from the need to provide security of tenure for landowners, who might be unable to prove their title due to various reasons such as fraud or lack of records.

The purpose of sham peer review is to generate positive reviews that appear to be from experts in the field, but are actually written by individuals with little or no expertise in the area. This can lead to inaccurate and misleading reviews that may influence decisions about funding, publication, tenure, or hiring.

When Jarvis left the show in 1951, film star Eddie Albert took his place and co-hosted with White for six months until thirty-three and a half hours of live ad-lib television per week, featuring just the two of them, took its toll and he also resigned.

1071," 2087+4007, is a binary star system located about 65 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Pegasus. It consists of two stars: a main sequence star and a subgiant star. The primary component is an O-type star with a mass of approximately 12 solar masses and a surface temperature of around 30,000 Kelvin. The secondary component is a subgiant star that has expanded to about 8 times the size of the Sun due to nuclear fusion in its core. This expansion makes it one of the largest known stars in the galaxy. V391 Pegasi b was discovered in 2004 by astronomers using the radial velocity method, and it is considered a prime candidate for studying the formation and evolution of binary star systems.",1.0,1.4274193548387097,6.065789473684211,20.666666666666668,0.3870967741935484,0.017064846416382253,-46.61214285714283,51.06269841269841,57.7015873015873,17.1545126984127,172.36426314277506,0.9077802624128376,0.019330503868193,0.9428571428571428,0.9275641025641023,0.017383746197305518,0.17762445058646784,0.11434108527131782

In the Middle Ages, Antwerp was one of the economic centers of Flanders, next to Bruges and Ghent. Because of that, indoor trade markets were founded, one of which was the Vleeshuis.  It is not known when the first one was built. The second Vleeshuis was built in 1250 near the castle of Antwerp. It was commissioned by the Duke of Brabant and paid for by the city of Antwerp. A central meat market enabled the city to regulate the meat industry, limiting the number of butchers permitted to sell to 52. The building may have also functioned as a slaughterhouse. In 1290, John I, Duke of Brabant recognized the guild of Antwerp butchers, resulting in butchers' guild being the oldest trade guild in Antwerp. In time, many of the butcher families became wealthy.

The route runs from U.S. Route 322 Business (US 322 Bus.) in West Chester east to PA 611 in Philadelphia. The route begins in downtown West Chester and heads east out of the borough as a one-way pair of streets. Between West Chester and Upper Darby, PA 3 follows a four-lane divided highway named West Chester Pike through suburban areas. Along this stretch, the route passes through Edgmont, Newtown Square, Broomall, and Havertown. The route has an interchange with Interstate 476 (I-476) between Broomall and Havertown. Upon reaching Upper Darby, PA 3 heads into Philadelphia along Market Street. In Philadelphia, the route follows multiple one-way pairs, running along Chestnut Street eastbound and Walnut Street westbound in West Philadelphia before heading into Center City Philadelphia along Market Street eastbound and John F. Kennedy Boulevard westbound and ending at Philadelphia City Hall. Philadelphia and West Chester were linked by a dirt road dating back to 1793. The Philadelphia and West Chester Turnpike Company was created to build a toll road between the two places in 1848. The turnpike was built as a plank road between Philadelphia and Newtown Square in the 1850s before becoming a stone road in the 1880s. A horse-drawn rail line was built along part of the turnpike in the 1850s and a trolley service was introduced in the 1890s. The state took over the West Chester Pike in 1918. In 1927, the route was designated as part of PA 5. PA 3 replaced the PA 5 designation between West Chester and Philadelphia in 1937. Trolley service was replaced by buses in the 1950s to allow for the widening of PA 3 between West Chester and Philadelphia to four lanes. By 1960, PA 3 was shifted to end at US 13 in Southwest Philadelphia. The routing was shifted to US 13 west of University City by 1970 before the route was extended east to Philadelphia City Hall during the 1970s.",0.0,1.2759643916913948,5.673913043478261,17.736842105263158,0.2789317507418398,0.019358741681790685,-250.87050295857986,132.21934911242602,137.09349112426034,26.19408106508876,189.67312930620096,0.8429895022862547,0.027278931523915178,0.9047619047619049,0.9086092715231808,0.01902752662246333,0.1677646905075252,0.06798245614035088

The largest of them are wide-body jets which are also called twin-aisle because they generally have two separate aisles running from the front to the back of the passenger cabin.

1114,", also known as Attorney General v Ahkter, is an English family law Court of Appeal case concerning the validity of an Islamic ceremony of marriage. A woman who recently divorced her husband petitioned the court to determine whether the marriage, resulting from a Nikah, was void marriage or a non-marriage. The Family Court had held the marriage was void, granting her financial remedies. The Court of Appeal subsequently reversed the decision and denied financial remedies. The case received much scholarly and media attention on the requirements for marriage and the protection of vulnerable spouses. Context 
The Marriage Act 1949 and Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 set out conditions for a marriage ceremony to be recognized as valid, void, voidable or outside the Marriage Acts. A valid marriage satisfies all the conditions in the Marriage Acts; the parties may benefit from all the legal consequences such as equitable division of property and pension sharing. A void marriage fails one of the 'essential requirements' in the Marriage Act; a decree of nullity can be granted which allows the parties to get the same financial remedies as on divorce. A voidable marriage is one that can be annulled at the option of one of the parties if one of the grounds are met. A 'non-marriage' is outside the Marriage Acts, with the parties treated as cohabiting couples.",0.0,1.4017857142857142,6.54014598540146,22.4,0.40358744394618834,0.021034180543382998,-38.73839686098651,46.36226457399103,54.106726457399105,14.83147399103139,232.18197825597346,0.8740934892474502,0.023323956263331936,0.880952380952381,0.8840579710144929,0.02332373508844097,0.17412915539501816,0.11504424778761062

Sizerville State Park is named after the nearby ghost town of Sizerville, Pennsylvania, which was in turn named for the Sizer family, early settlers of the region. With the end of the logging boom of the late 19th century, the town was gradually abandoned. Sizerville State Park was first opened in 1924. The first park facilities were opened in 1927. The Civilian Conservation Corps led an effort to reforest the lands surrounding Sizerville State park during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Thousands of acres of old growth timber had been logged at the turn of the 20th century. The CCC planted thousands of acres of white pine and hemlock trees. Today these trees have reached maturity and make up most of the forested acres of Sizerville State Park.",0.0,1.309278350515464,6.095238095238095,17.636363636363637,0.31443298969072164,0.01962809917355372,-14.159175257731917,39.33175257731959,41.68659793814433,14.307906185567012,256.50969529085876,0.8851476256385885,0.021889050399214283,0.8555555555555557,0.8617424242424242,0.02578668894458368,0.1700512015978345,0.09125

Vitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant which may help protect cell membranes from reactive oxygen species. Worldwide, government organizations recommend adults consume in the range of 3 to 15 mg per day.

1162,"The Flat Tops is a mountain range located in Colorado within the Routt and White River National Forests. Much of the range is within the boundary of the Flat Tops Wilderness Area. While there are notable peaks in the Flat Tops, the dominant feature of the range is the high plateau from which the peaks arise. The plateau forms the northeastern portion of the White River Uplift capped by horizontal basalt flows from tertiary volcanic activity and is bounded by steep drops to valleys carved out by subsequent glaciation. The resulting mix of areas of treeless plateau at an elevation of 11,000 to 12,000 feet interspersed with verdant valleys is unique among Colorado mountain ranges. The area contains approximately one hundred and ten ponds and lakes and is home to a wide variety of plants and animals, including many large mammals such as moose, elk, mule deer, black bear, and cougars. This area has been affected by the non-native plant species, yellow toadflax. The most common trees are Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir and lodgepole pine, with aspen groves at lower elevations. The top of the plateau is alpine tundra. The highest point in the Flat Tops is the summit of Flat Top Mountain (12,361 ft) on the east side of the range. The Devil's Causeway, perhaps the most popular geologic feature and notorious hiking experience in the Flat Tops, is located in the same area. The Causeway is a narrow neck of the plateau where eroding glaciers on either side almost met.

1179,"Meic Stevens (born 13 March 1942) is a Welsh singer-songwriter. Stevens's songs have a mystical, faintly psychedelic flavour, and are mostly sung in his native Welsh language. Still largely unknown outside Wales, he was discovered by DJ Jimmy Savile, who saw him performing in a Manchester folk club in 1965. This led to Stevens recording his first single – with arranger John Paul Jones (later of Led Zeppelin) – for Decca Records that same year, though it sold badly. Early life

1202,"Joseph Arthur de Gobineau (; 14 July 1816 – 13 October 1882) was a French aristocrat who is best known for helping to legitimise racism by the use of scientific racist theory and ""racial demography"", and for developing the theory of the Aryan master race. Known to his contemporaries as a novelist, diplomat and travel writer, he was an elitist who, in the immediate aftermath of the Revolutions of 1848, wrote An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races. In it he argued aristocrats were superior to commoners, and that aristocrats possessed more Aryan genetic traits because of less interbreeding with inferior races. Gobineau's writings were quickly praised by white supremacist, pro-slavery Americans like Josiah C. Nott and Henry Hotze, who translated his book into English. They omitted around 1,000 pages of the original book, including those parts that negatively described Americans as a racially mixed population. Inspiring a social movement in Germany named Gobinism, his works were also influential on prominent antisemites like Richard Wagner, Wagner's son-in-law Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the Romanian politician Professor A.

 200 word wikipedia introduction on 'Mountains'
   Mountains are landforms that rise high above the surrounding terrain and are typically characterized by steep slopes, rocky outcroppings, and often snowfields or glaciers.

1235,"Thaumaci or Thaumacus , was a town and polis (city-state) of Phthiotis in Ancient Thessaly, was situated on the pass called Coela, on the road from Thermopylae and the Maliac Gulf passing through Lamia. The modern city of Domokos occupies its site. At this place, says Livy, the traveller, after traversing rugged mountains and intricate valleys, comes suddenly in sight of an immense plain like a vast sea, the extremity of which is scarcely visible. From the astonishment which it excited in the traveller, the city was supposed to have derived its name. It stood upon a lofty and precipitous rock. It was besieged by Philip V of Macedon in 199 BCE; but a reinforcement of Aetolians having made their way into the town, the king was obliged to abandon the siege. Thaumaci was taken by the consul Acilius in the war with Antiochus, 191 BCE. The modern town of Domokos occupies the site of Thaumaci, and at this place inscriptions were found containing the ancient name. Its situation and prospect are in exact accordance with the description of Livy, who copied from Polybius, an eye-witness. William Martin Leake observes that ""at the southern end of the town a rocky point, overtopping the other heights, commands a magnificent prospect of the immense plain watered by the Peneius and its branches."" The town was Christianised at an early date and a bishopric was set up (see Thaumacensis).",0.0,1.3983050847457628,6.220588235294118,21.454545454545453,0.39148936170212767,0.02586206896551724,-158.76999999999998,93.78510638297873,99.27659574468086,21.205351063829788,176.463003555048,0.9012328435369092,0.01811896160785363,0.92,0.9226788432267895,0.01772236199496818,0.17013626253660996,0.0993723849372385
1236,"Floyd Alburn Firestone (1898–1986) was an acoustical physicist, who in 1940 while a professor at the University of Michigan invented the first practical ultrasonic testing method and apparatus. He was granted US Patent 2,280,226 for the invention in 1942. Manufactured by Sperry Corporation, the testing device was known variously as the Firestone-Sperry Reflectoscope, the Sperry Ultrasonic Reflectoscope, the Sperry Reflectoscope and sometimes also just as a Supersonic Reflectoscope, the name Firestone had originally coined for the instrument. The technology is not just used in quality control in factories to reject defective parts before shipment, but also revolutionized transportation safety. For example, ultrasonic testing is used for safety maintenance inspection of railroad cars, particularly axles and wheels, aircraft, particularly fuselages, and other transportation vessels for material fatigue. Dr. Firestone’s ultrasonic pulse echo technique for metal defect testing was also later applied in medical diagnosis, giving birth to the field of Echocardiography and to the field of Medical Ultrasonography, generally. Dr. Firestone was the editor of the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America from 1939-1957. Among Firestone’s many other inventions in his field are in a single year an “automatic device for the minute inspection of flaws”, “a new and useful improvement in hook-up of electrical apparatus”, and “[a] device for measuring noise”, and, even, later a “musical typewriter”. In 1933, Firestone proposed an alternative to the mechanical–electrical analogy of James Clerk Maxwell in which force is made the analogy of voltage (the impedance analogy).  Firestone's analogy (now called the mobility analogy) makes force the analogy of current.  In this work he introduced the concept of ""through"" and ""across"" variables and demonstrated that there were analogies for these variables in other energy domains, making it possible to treat a complex system as a unified whole in analysis.  Firestone's analogy became popular amongst mechanical filter designers because it has the property of preserving network topologies when transforming between the mechanical and electrical domains.",0.0,1.6666666666666667,7.0754716981132075,26.75,0.3395638629283489,0.02223398623610376,-285.2428571428571,134.77775075987842,140.8401215805471,27.72991519756839,133.30168901546614,0.9041026896097993,0.01664291135563085,0.907936507936508,0.9041666666666677,0.013372219907545186,0.19477685388408125,0.11897590361445784

As such, ""Moluccans"" is used as a blanket term for the various ethnic and linguistic groups native to the islands.
	
The original inhabitants of the Maluku Islands were Austronesian and Melanesian in origin. Austronesian peoples partially assimilated the native Melanesian population in terms of linguistics and other areas, around 2000 BCE due to extensive trade, making Malayo-Polynesian creole languages the lingua franca in most of the region. Later added to this were several Dutch, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Arabian and English influences due to colonization, marriage with foreign traders during the Silk-route era and Middle ages, and even with European soldiers during the World Wars. A small number of German descendants was added to Moluccan population, especially in Ambon, along with arrival of Protestant Missionaries since 16th century. Moluccans are predominantly Christian like many other Melanesians, but Muslim villages are also present. Despite religious differences, all groups share strong cultural bonds and a sense of common identity, such as through Adat, Pela and Bongso traditions.

The first settlement in New Hampshire, originally named Pannaway Plantation, was established in 1623 at Odiorne's Point by a group of fishermen led by David Thompson. The settlement was abandoned in favor of Strawbery Banke, which became Portsmouth. The first settler in present-day Rye was probably William Berry. Prior to its incorporation in 1726 as a parish of New Castle, Rye was called ""Sandy Beach"" and its lands were once parts of New Castle, Portsmouth, Greenland and Hampton. In 1726, the town of New Castle set off a parish for Sandy Beach called ""Rye"", for Rye in Sussex, England, the ancestral lands of the Jenness family who continue to live in the town to this day and even have a beach named after them. The town was incorporated in 1785. In 2013, a researcher pointed out that the town seal showed the parish creation date of 1726 as the incorporation date.

The construction date of the church is not known, but it appears to have been built during the third quarter of the 12th century. The tower, which originally was higher than today, was built somewhat later, probably during the 13th century, while the church porch was added in the 16th century. The vaults of the nave are from the 15th century. Additional changes to the church were made in the 19th century. The ceiling of the chancel was installed in 1839, and in 1868 the church was equipped with new, larger windows. A comprehensive refurbishment of the interior was carried out between 1883 and 1884.

1247,"In mathematics, an almost periodic function is, loosely speaking, a function of a real number that is periodic to within any desired level of accuracy, given suitably long, well-distributed ""almost-periods"". The concept was first studied by Harald Bohr and later generalized by Vyacheslav Stepanov, Hermann Weyl and Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch, amongst others. There is also a notion of almost periodic functions on locally compact abelian groups, first studied by John von Neumann. Almost periodicity is a property of dynamical systems that appear to retrace their paths through phase space, but not exactly. An example would be a planetary system, with planets in orbits moving with periods that are not commensurable (i.e., with a period vector that is not proportional to a vector of integers). A theorem of Kronecker from diophantine approximation can be used to show that any particular configuration that occurs once, will recur to within any specified accuracy: if we wait long enough we can observe the planets all return to within a second of arc to the positions they once were in.",0.0,1.4914285714285713,6.780952380952381,29.166666666666668,0.41714285714285715,0.0249728555917481,-120.33568181818177,73.76704545454545,76.9909090909091,19.18450909090909,92.32954545454545,0.9193704488144904,0.01559419800213784,0.9272727272727274,0.9386831275720167,0.009285714285714286,0.16814915895374502,0.12005649717514125

Dagmar Burešová, a young female lawyer, became part of his legacy by defending Palach's family in a trial against the communist government, a regime which tried to dishonour Palach’s sacrifice, a heroic action for the freedom of Czechoslovakia. The fight for freedom, for moral principles, self-sacrifice and protest in those desperate times led to the moral unification of a repressed nation, which twenty years later defeated the totalitarian regime.

1257,"An elder or progenitor race, in science fiction, fantasy, or horror fiction, is an ancient race that not only preceded but helped shape the races that followed, often playing a significant role in the basis of the story. Humanity may have been descended from them, or they may be a different fictional race, such as elves, dwarves, or aliens. While in some cases, whether they currently exist is unclear, in other instances, members of an elder race still inhabit the world, either openly or in secret. In order to hide their existence, they may make use of a wainscot society, inhabit a parallel universe, only visiting the current one occasionally, or disguise themselves as a fool, deity, magician or trickster. One such example is in Lord of Light (1967), where highly advanced humans take on the identities of Hindu deities and act as gods to the less advanced colonists. Elder races are typically either technologically or spiritually powerful, as well as wise. While sometimes benevolent, assisting younger races, they can also often be amoral, as in H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, where the Elder Gods are indifferent to humanity's ""petty"" concerns. They are usually presented as having drifted apart from humanity in the present of the story, sometimes as lost empires whose inhabitants either left their former home for a new one, or were destroyed by a catastrophe and only live on in legend, such as Atlantis.

1267,"Plutopia: Nuclear Families, Atomic Cities, and the Great Soviet and American Plutonium Disasters is a 2013 book by American environmental historian Kate Brown. The book is a comparative history of the cities of Richland, in the northwest United States adjacent to the U.S. Department of Energy Hanford Site plutonium production area, and Ozersk, in Russia's southern Ural mountain region. These two cities were home to the world's first plutonium production sites, and in Plutopia Brown charts the environmental and social impacts of those sites on the residents of and the environment surrounding the two cities. Brown argues that the demands of plutonium production – both the danger of the physical process and the secrecy required in the Cold War context – led both US and Soviet officials to create ""Plutopias,"" ideal communities to placate resident families in exchange for their cooperation and control over their bodies. This entailed creating significant state-run welfare programs along with high levels of consumerism in both places. However, each city witnessed what Brown terms ""slow-motion disasters"" via the slow, and usually controlled, release of high levels of radiation into their surrounding environments. Awards

The original chords and melody for ""Starless"" were written by John Wetton, who intended the song to be the title track of the group's previous album Starless and Bible Black. Robert Fripp and Bill Bruford initially disliked the song and declined to record it for that album. Instead the group chose an instrumental improvisation as the title track. However, ""Starless"" was later revived, its lyrics altered and a long instrumental section (based on a bass riff written by Bruford) added to it, and performed live between March and June 1974. For the Red recording sessions, the lyrics were again altered (with contributions by Richard Palmer-James). The introductory theme, originally played by David Cross, was taken over by the guitar, with Fripp making minor alterations to the melody.

It usually persists for a very long time, and often until the patient is around 40 years old.  Although it often occurs where there is already an active acne problem, it can also happen to people whose acne has subsided.  Although the cause of this type of acne is unknown, it is associated with testosterone and thus appears mainly in males.  It can be caused by anabolic steroid abuse and sometimes appears in males after stopping testosterone therapy.  It can also happen to someone who has a tumor that is releasing large amounts of androgens, or to people in remission from diseases, such as leukemia.

Armstrong Field did have the advantage of being located next to an outdoor school swimming pool. Legend has it that collegians would sit in the two rows at the top of the stands to see the women at the pool instead of watching the ballgame. Some were hit with foul balls due to their concentration on the women at the pool. The pool helped augment attendance by 40%. Armstrong Field was closed after the 1976 season, but before the last game the players stole home plate and concealed it in the storage area of Ownby Stadium.

In multivariable calculus, this theorem can be generalized to any continuously differentiable, vector-valued function whose Jacobian determinant is nonzero at a point in its domain, giving a formula for the Jacobian matrix of the inverse. There are also versions of the inverse function theorem for complex holomorphic functions, for differentiable maps between manifolds, for differentiable functions between Banach spaces, and so forth.

1322,"Coutoucou Hubert Maga (August 10, 1916 – May 8, 2000) was a politician from Dahomey (now known as Benin). He arose on a political scene where one's power was dictated by what region in Dahomey one lived in. Born a peasant in 1916, Maga served as a schoolmaster from 1936 to 1945, during which time he gradually gained considerable influence among the uneducated. He was elected to Dahomey's territorial assembly in 1947 and founded the Northern Ethnical Group, later renamed the Dahomey Democratic Rally (Rassemblement Démocratique du Dahomé). In 1951, Maga was elected to the French National Assembly, where he served in various positions, including premier from 1959 to 1960. When Dahomey gained its independence from France on August 1, 1960, Maga was appointed to the presidency, and was officially elected to that post on December 11. During Maga's term of office, Dahomey's economy collapsed; there was little foreign investment and unemployment rose. In response, he launched a four-year plan in January 1962, the basis of which was to increase agricultural production by forcing the nation's youths to work on the land. Maga also faced a national crisis of unity, culminating in a failed assassination plot against him in May 1961 led by the main opposition leader, Justin Ahomadegbé-Tomêtin. Ahomadegbé-Tomêtin was jailed, and by the time of his release in November 1962, a one-party state had been established and the opposition press had been restricted. In 1963, convicted murderer Christophe Bokhiri was released from prison, prompting riots around the country, but the focus of the rioting soon shifted toward Maga's problems as president. The riots became so serious that the Chief of Staff of the Dahomeyan Army, Christophe Soglo, took control of the country in October to prevent a civil war. After forcing Maga to resign, Soglo gave him, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, and vice president Sourou Migan Apithy, the titles of Minister of State.",0.0,1.4583333333333333,6.278048780487805,24.0,0.32051282051282054,0.028693528693528692,-250.2266246056782,126.91255520504731,132.09968454258677,26.781498107255523,124.15968501470901,0.9009471580464101,0.01737633934593482,0.9263157894736843,0.9377777777777797,0.012457632825301341,0.17867063899660904,0.0874613003095975

1336,"The Wealden hall house is a type of vernacular medieval timber-framed hall house traditional in the south east of England. Typically built for a yeoman, it is most common in Kent (hence ""Wealden"" for the once densely forested  Weald) and the east of Sussex but has also been built elsewhere.  Kent has one of the highest concentrations of such surviving medieval timber-framed buildings in Europe. The original floor plan usually had four bays with the two central ones forming the main hall open to the roof with the hearth in the middle and two doors to the outside at one end forming a cross passage. The open hearth was later moved towards the cross passage and became a fireplace with chimney, sometimes the chimney pile even blocking the cross passage, which had soon been screened off the main hall. Beyond the cross passage the outer bay at the ""screens end"" or ""lower end"" of the hall, usually contained two rooms commonly called buttery and pantry, while the rooms in the bay at the other end, the ""upper end"", were called parlours. The end bays each had an upper floor containing solars, which did not communicate with each other, as the hall rose to the rafters between them. The upper stories on both ends typically extended beyond the lower outer wall being jettied on at least one side of the building. As the main hall had no upper floor the outer wall ran straight up without jettying, and thus the central bays appeared recessed.

They are non-pigmented, in contrast to other plastids such as the chloroplast.

They may be specialized for bulk storage of starch, lipid or protein and are then known as amyloplasts, elaioplasts, or proteinoplasts (also called aleuroplasts) respectively. However, in many cell types, leucoplasts do not have a major storage function and are present to provide a wide range of essential biosynthetic functions, including the synthesis of fatty acids such as palmitic acid, many amino acids, and tetrapyrrole compounds such as heme. In general, leucoplasts are much smaller than chloroplasts and have a variable morphology, often described as amoeboid. Extensive networks of stromules interconnecting leucoplasts have been observed in epidermal cells of roots, hypocotyls, and petals, and in callus and suspension culture cells of tobacco.

Historically, the street was one of the main routes into Edinburgh from the south, meeting St Mary's Wynd (now St Mary's Street) at St Mary's Wynd Port, one of the gateways of the town walls.

1380,"Louis XV (15 February 1710 – 10 May 1774), known as Louis the Beloved , was King of France from 1 September 1715 until his death in 1774. He succeeded his great-grandfather Louis XIV at the age of five. Until he reached maturity (then defined as his 13th birthday) on 15 February 1723, the kingdom was ruled by Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, as Regent of France.
Cardinal Fleury was chief minister from 1726 until his death in 1743, at which time the king took sole control of the kingdom. His reign of almost 59 years (from 1715 to 1774) was the second longest in the history of France, exceeded only by his predecessor, Louis XIV, who had ruled for 72 years (from 1643 to 1715).  In 1748, Louis returned the Austrian Netherlands, won at the Battle of Fontenoy of 1745. He ceded New France in North America to Great Britain and Spain at the conclusion of the disastrous Seven Years' War in 1763. He incorporated the territories of the Duchy of Lorraine and the Corsican Republic into the Kingdom of France. Historians generally criticise his reign, citing how reports of his corruption embarrassed the monarchy, while his wars drained the treasury while producing little gain. His grandson and successor Louis XVI would inherit a kingdom in need of financial and political reform which would ultimately lead to the French Revolution of 1789.",0.0,1.3090128755364807,5.872340425531915,23.3,0.33189655172413796,0.02164111812443643,-21.732564935064914,44.984004329004335,50.52900432900433,15.927377922077921,192.7437641723356,0.8906074746843128,0.020458261721362652,0.9282051282051282,0.9248299319727901,0.019366598313966733,0.17397321702453997,0.07051282051282051

1391,"A  goldsmith banker was a business role that emerged in seventeenth century London from the London goldsmiths where they gradually expanded their services to include storage of wealth, providing loans, transferring money and providing bills of exchange that would lead to the development of cheques.  Some of the concepts were brought over from Amsterdam where goldsmiths would provide gold storage and issue chits that started to be used as a means of exchange.  The goldsmith banker became a key development in the history of banking that would lead to modern banking. History
Their emergence was gradual: exchanging goldsmiths, who dealt in coinage, started to become recognised as carrying out a different activity from a working goldsmith in the 1630s. Prior to that date banking in London was principally carried out by foreigners, generally Italians, Germans, and the Dutch. However this innovation led to an indigenous banking tradition. The seizure of the mint by Charles I in 1640 created anxiety about the safe storage of valuables, which was further increased during the English Civil War, which also disrupted the regular work of the working goldsmiths. They soon developed accountancy practices to keep track of deposits. Then they also started paying interest on deposits so they could loan out increasing quantities of gold. The depositor was given a receipt with their name and the amount of the deposit. Such receipts became negotiable and thus evolved into the bank note.",0.0,1.3755274261603376,6.72027972027972,21.545454545454547,0.3628691983122363,0.016773162939297124,-46.946297468354416,49.246097046413496,54.3198312236287,15.44367805907173,126.75955185291583,0.9031160015928715,0.017731877895292264,0.9600000000000002,0.9375375375375393,0.01272989542012261,0.16207922947312764,0.12344398340248963

1394,"Linda Ronstadt  is the third solo studio album by Linda Ronstadt, released in early 1972 on the Capitol Records label. The album was a sales failure, prompting Linda's exit from Capitol Records.  It peaked at No. 163 on Billboard's  Pop Album Chart and #35 on Billboard's Country Album Chart. It is considered to be a front-runner in the country rock music genre. History
Before recording the album, Ronstadt hired guitarist Glenn Frey to assemble a touring band; Frey did so with members of drummer Don Henley’s band Shiloh, who were signed to Amos Records at the same time as Frey’s previous band, Longbranch Pennywhistle.  The touring band, augmented by pedal steel guitarist Sneaky Pete Kleinow and producer John Boylan on guitar, accompanied Ronstadt on six of the album’s ten tracks, including three that were recorded live at The Troubadour nightclub in West Hollywood, California during March of 1971.  The other members of the original Eagles lineup, guitarist Bernie Leadon and bassist Randy Meisner, appeared on other tracks as session musicians, with Meisner accompanying Ronstadt on backing vocals with the live band on “Birds” and “Rescue Me”.  Frey, Henley, Leadon and Meisner formed the Eagles, with Ronstadt's approval,  after the album's release.  Other notable session musicians on the album include violinist Gib Guilbeau, pedal steel guitarist Buddy Emmons, harmonica player Jimmy Fadden of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and Herb Pedersen on guitar, banjo and backing vocals.",0.0,1.423728813559322,5.80225988700565,23.6,0.2711864406779661,0.02875399361022364,-44.58844262295078,49.786721311475404,52.24262295081967,18.229831147540985,113.22971745980878,0.8997671566953123,0.018330603672526563,0.937777777777778,0.9351270553064293,0.01137095043981978,0.1912004840238496,0.08956692913385828
1395,"The Tumansky M-88 was an air-cooled radial engine for aircraft developed in the Soviet Union shortly before World War II. Design and development
The M-88 was designed to address the shortcomings of the Tumansky M-87.  The improvements incorporated in the M-88 were a strengthened crankcase, crankshaft, connecting rods, waffle ribbing at the piston bottom and a two speed geared centrifugal supercharger.  The M-88 retained the same bore/stroke and displacement as the M-87 while increasing power to 1,000-1,150 hp.  Design work began in 1937 and by 1939 the first prototypes were being flight tested in the Polikarpov I-180 fighter prototypes.  At first the M-88 was not a success, but the designers persisted and the M-88 was made into a reliable and widely produced engine.  There were a number of different variants with the most numerous being the M-88B, of which 10,585 were produced at Zaporozhye and Omsk.  The M-88B solved most of the mechanical failures associated with the M-87 and early M-88's by including oil injectors in the crankshaft, improved cooling and strengthened drive components.  16,087 M-88's were produced.  In hindsight, the Tumansky family of engines developed from the Gnome-Rhône 9K and Gnome-Rhône 14K were far less successful than the Shvetsov family of engines developed from the Wright R-1820.",0.0,1.3365384615384615,6.724409448818897,20.8,0.34134615384615385,0.02062780269058296,-19.93052325581391,42.745232558139534,50.627906976744185,16.386127906976746,243.18974455650866,0.8889467957492889,0.02084380355933476,0.9076923076923079,0.9017361111111116,0.024437603599336964,0.16873400711733844,0.10242290748898678
1396,"Tolerable daily intake (TDI) refers to the daily amount of a chemical that has been assessed safe for human being on long-term basis (usually whole lifetime). Originally acceptable daily intake (ADI) was introduced in 1961 to define the daily intake of a food additive which, during the entire lifetime, appears to be without appreciable risk. For contaminants and other foreign chemicals not used intentionally, the term TDI is often preferred. Both ADI and TDI are usually assessed based on animal experiments, and it is most often hundreds of times lower than the dose causing no observable adverse effect (NOAEL) in the most sensitive tested animal species. Because the uncertainty factors (safety factors) may vary depending on the quality of data and the type of adverse effect, TDI values are not good estimates of the harmfulness of chemicals, and must be considered administrative tools to set allowable limits for chemicals, rather than scientific measures. The threshold limit value (TLV) of a chemical substance is a level to which it is believed a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime without adverse effects.

A bedpan can be used for both urinary and fecal discharge. Many diseases can confine a patient to bed, necessitating the use of bedpans, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and dementia. Additionally, many patients may be confined to a bed temporarily as a result of a temporary illness, injury, or surgery. Bedpans are usually constructed of stainless steel, which is easy to clean and durable, but may be cold, hard, and uncomfortable to use.  Also, the supporting area of some products is very small, and prolonged use can cause pressure ulcers.

1414,"Monitor proofing or soft-proofing is a step in the prepress printing process. It uses specialized computer software and hardware to check the accuracy of text and images used for printed products. Monitor proofing differs from conventional forms of “hard-copy” or ink-on-paper color proofing in its use of a calibrated display(s) as the output device. Monitor proofing systems rely on calibration, profiling and color management to produce an accurate representation of how images will look when printed. 
While a “soft-proof” function has existed in desktop publishing applications for some time, commercial monitor proofing extends this capability to multiple users and multiple locations by specifying the hardware to be used, and by enforcing one set of calibration procedures and color management policies for all users of the system. This ensures that all viewers are calibrated to a known set of conditions, and given hardware of equal capabilities will therefore be viewing the same color on screen.",0.0,1.5844155844155845,7.061855670103093,25.666666666666668,0.4025974025974026,0.0117096018735363,-22.47008064516129,35.646612903225815,39.516129032258064,14.611467741935483,105.7232049947971,0.9090979587045557,0.018023870522136633,0.9600000000000002,0.9617021276595751,0.010640971931294513,0.15922222757457868,0.146875

1444,"Global aphasia is a severe form of nonfluent aphasia, caused by damage to the left side of the brain, that affects receptive and expressive language skills (needed for both written and oral language) as well as auditory and visual comprehension. Acquired impairments of communicative abilities are present across all language modalities, impacting language production, comprehension, and repetition. Patients with global aphasia may be able to verbalize a few short utterances and use non-word neologisms, but their overall production ability is limited. Their ability to repeat words, utterances, or phrases is also affected. Due to the preservation of the right hemisphere, an individual with global aphasia may still be able to express themselves through facial expressions, gestures, and intonation. This type of aphasia often results from a large lesion of the left perisylvian cortex. The lesion is caused by an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and is associated with damage to Broca's area, Wernicke's area, and insular regions which are associated with aspects of language. Signs and symptoms
It is most common for the onset of global aphasia to occur after a thrombotic stroke (at the trunk of the middle cerebral artery), with varying severity. The general signs and symptoms include the inability to understand, create, and repeat speech and language.  These difficulties also persist in reading, writing, and auditory comprehension abilities.
Verbal language typically consists of a few recognizable utterances and words (e.g., hello), overlearned phrases (e.g., how are you), and expletives (e.g., a curse word). However, those affected by global aphasia may express themselves using facial expressions, intonation, and gestures.  Extensive lexical (vocabulary) impairment is possible, resulting in an inability to read simple words or sentences. Global aphasia may be accompanied by weakness of the right side of the face and right hemiplegia (paralysis), but can occur with or without hemiparesis (weakness). Additionally, it is common for an individual with global aphasia to have one or more of the following additional impairments: apraxia of speech, alexia, pure word deafness, agraphia, facial apraxia, and depression.",0.0,1.5519287833827893,7.080188679245283,22.466666666666665,0.37091988130563797,0.030303030303030304,-61.996052631578905,50.227309941520474,55.658479532163746,16.2625081871345,110.80332409972299,0.885167695520421,0.01968055343255035,0.9272727272727274,0.9325203252032536,0.011112826053403304,0.18381737496280867,0.14680232558139536

1469,"V391 Pegasi b, also known as HS 2201+2610 b, is an extrasolar planet candidate orbiting the star V391 Pegasi approximately 4,570 light-years away in the constellation of Pegasus. The candidate planet was discovered by means of variable star timing, which measured anomalies in variability of the star caused by a planet. It is the first planet candidate to claim to be detected with this method. The discovery reported the planet candidate to have mass of 3.2 times Jupiter's (assuming an edge-on orbit), semi-major axis of 1.7 AU, and orbital period of 1,170 days. The planet candidate was discovered in March 2007 and published in September 2007. If it is confirmed, its survival would indicate that planets at Earth-like distances can survive their star's red-giant phase, though this is a much larger planet than Earth (about the same size as Jupiter and Saturn). Its existence has been called into question with further monitoring of the pulsations of the star which show deviations from the predicted behavior if this were in fact a planet.

1482,"The Suárez River, originally Saravita, is a river in the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes. The river originates in Lake Fúquene on the border of Cundinamarca and Boyacá and its mouth is the confluence with the Chicamocha River, forming the Sogamoso River in Santander. It is part of the Magdalena Basin flowing towards the Caribbean Sea. The  long river is one of the longest on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense and forms the natural borders of Cundinamarca and Boyacá and Boyacá and Santander in its upstream and downstream part respectively. The river formed the trajectory for the Spanish conquest of the Muisca, when the conquistadors went uphill into the Andes from the tropical lowlands of Barrancabermeja in the north. The difference in altitude along the river course, from  at the source to  at its mouth, in its  large basin causes climatic variations, especially with respect to precipitation.

In August 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, he joined John Becker, Candice Keller, and Nino Vitale in sponsoring a move to impeach against Mike DeWine, Ohio's Republican governor. The move was widely and immediately panned on both sides of the aisle and by legal scholars and commentators. Ohio Republican Party Chair Jane Timken ""issued a scathing condemnation of the trio of conservatives"", calling the move “a baseless, feeble attempt at creating attention for themselves.” Ohio House Speaker, Republican Bob Cupp, called it an ""imprudent attempt"" to cause ""a state constitutional crisis"". Legal scholar Jonathan Entin said the proposal ""means that we’ve distorted our understanding both of what impeachment is supposed to do and how people – especially, elected officials – are supposed to disagree with each other. Do we really want to say that the government can’t act in an emergency because the officials are afraid that if they do anything, they’ll be removed from office? Of course, if they don’t do anything, maybe the response is going to be ‘Well you should be impeached for not acting.'

It reached Britain through recordings and performers who visited the country while it was a relatively new genre, soon after the end of World War I.

1532,"Ballet as a music form progressed from simply a complement to dance, to a concrete compositional form that often had as much value as the dance that went along with it. The dance form, originating in France during the 17th century, began as a theatrical dance. It was not until the 19th century that ballet gained status as a “classical” form. In ballet, the terms ‘classical’ and ‘romantic’ are chronologically reversed from musical usage. Thus, the 19th century Classical period in ballet coincided with the 19th century Romantic era in music. Ballet music composers from the 17th–20th centuries, including the likes of Jean-Baptiste Lully, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Igor Stravinsky, and Sergei Prokofiev, were predominantly in France and Russia. Yet with the increased international notoriety seen in Tchaikovsky's and Stravinsky's lifetime, ballet music composition and ballet in general spread across the western world. History
Until about the second half of the 19th century, the role of music in ballet was secondary, with the main emphasis on dance, while music was simply a compilation of danceable tunes. Writing ""ballet music"" used to be a job for musical craftsmen, rather than for masters. For example, critics of the Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840–1893) mentioned his writing of ballet music as something demeaning.",0.0,1.5,6.330985915492958,21.0,0.3476190476190476,0.026362038664323375,-37.76252336448596,45.10822429906543,49.71588785046729,15.805709345794392,158.12762516565215,0.8833171023615815,0.021802315145194682,0.8952380952380954,0.9018612521150603,0.015888061385691717,0.18195227195294603,0.12733644859813084

In 1637 he moved to Italy where he spent several years studying the works of Caravaggio and other Italian painters. During this period he painted many religious works, including The Supper at Emmaus (now in the National Gallery of Ireland). He returned to Delft in 1649 and continued to paint portraits until his death in 1685. Maetsuycker is known for his use of light and shadow in his paintings, which created a sense of depth and drama.

1535,"A self bow or simple bow is a bow made from a single piece of wood. Extra material such as horn nocks on the ends, or built-up handles, would normally be accepted as part of a self bow. Some modern authorities would also accept a bow spliced together in the handle from two pieces of wood. Comparison with composite bows 
An effective self bow can be made from widely available local material in most inhabited parts of the world, with limited tools whose functions include chopping, shaving, and scraping. A day of work may be needed, starting with a seasoned stave; a composite bow requires a week's work, and could possibly take up to several years, starting with a much greater range of materials and skills. Self bows must be approximately the height of the archer if they are to allow a long draw, and they are less efficient in the specialized art of flight archery.  Well-designed composite bows of high draw-weight give higher arrow velocity, and the bow itself is shorter. However, the hide glue that holds a composite bow together absorbs water and will dissolve if soaked; the wood of self bows is less sensitive to humidity.

Jacobsohn graduated from Columbia University with B.S. in 1938 and M.S in 1939. At the beginning of the Manhattan Project, he worked with Enrico Fermi at Columbia. Jacobsohn, along with his wife Ruth, moved with Fermi's team in early 1942 to the University of Chicago for the team's relocation to the Metallurgical Laboratory, where he worked until the end of WWII. In late 1945, Edward Teller invited Maria Goeppert-Mayer, along with her two students Boris Jacobsohn and Harris Mayer, to Los Alamos to work on the development of the thermonuclear bomb. For this work, Jacobsohn received, in 1947 after declassification of the research, his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago with thesis under the supervision of Edward Teller. For the academic year 1947–1948, Jacobsohn was an instructor at Stanford University. In 1948 he became an assistant professor in the physics department of the University of Washington.

1549,"Perryella is an extinct genus of dvinosaurian temnospondyl. The type and only species, P. olsoni, was named in 1987 from the Wellington Formation of Oklahoma, which is Early Permian in age. It is known from several skulls and partial remains of vertebrae and limbs. It has large orbits, or eye sockets, and large otic notches (rounded indentations at the back of the skull). A bone called the palatine, which is usually found on the underside of the skull, is partially exposed on the top of the skull. Present on the margin of the orbit, the palatine takes the place of the lacrimal bone, which usually touches the orbit in temnospondyls. Another distinguishing feature of Perryella is the presence of two small projections on the quadratojugal bone at the back of the skull. The lowermost projection forms a cup-like shape that attaches to the lower jaw. The classification of Perryella was at first uncertain because it shared features with two groups, Trimerorhachidae and Dissorophoidea, which were thought to be distantly related. In 2006, a phylogenetic analysis involving Perryella placed it within Dvinosauria as an intermediate form between trimerorhachids and other dvinosaurs.",0.0,1.4631578947368422,6.836363636363636,19.0,0.4,0.023023023023023025,-119.59394736842103,77.14157894736843,82.73684210526316,19.542710526315787,216.16115889542777,0.9010887363573602,0.01888902127527539,0.8833333333333333,0.8831417624521067,0.021731710092160655,0.19091871767334118,0.11518324607329844

1562,"The history of Madagascar is distinguished clearly by the early isolation of the landmass from the ancient supercontinent containing Africa and India, and by the island's late colonization by human settlers from the Sunda islands (Malay Archipelago) and from East Africa. 
These two factors facilitated the evolution and survival of thousands of endemic plant and animal species, some of which have gone extinct or are currently threatened with extinction due to the government not allocating resources to help the growing population, causing many people to resort to harmful environmental practices as a way of survival.
Trade in the Indian Ocean at the time of first colonization of Madagascar was dominated by large ships, called Djong, coming from Java and Sumatra. Over the past two thousand years the island has received waves of settlers of diverse origins including Austronesian, Bantu, Arab, South Asian, Chinese and European.

Jacobson was born in 1971 to a Jewish family. His father was an inventor and his mother was a teacher. Jacobson was raised in Watford. A talented musician, his childhood ambition was to become a singer, and he spent more time on music than education when at school, singing or playing at the Royal Opera House, Royal Albert Hall, Royal Festival Hall, the Barbican and St Martin-in-the-Fields during this time, and appeared in Carmen alongside José Carreras. However his singing ability was affected by the voice change during puberty. He attended Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School on a scholarship – fellow pupils at the time included Matt Lucas and Sacha Baron Cohen. He also became a keen fan of Watford F.C. in his childhood, attending his first game at Vicarage Road on his seventh birthday. His interest in and love for music sowed the seeds for his early career; while working in a record shop he produced a fanzine which caught the eye of the then NME editor Steve Lamacq. Lamacq helped Jacobson to secure his first position in the music business, introducing him to Andy Ross of Food Records, who hired him as an A&R manager. During his time in the music business (with Food and Polygram Island Music), Jacobson worked with a number of household names, including Jesus Jones, Dubstar, Shampoo, Blur, Feeder, Fatboy Slim and The Bluetones.",0.0,1.3929961089494163,6.024390243902439,21.416666666666668,0.3035019455252918,0.0282574568288854,-53.957306949806934,52.95669884169884,56.12432432432433,15.912364092664092,104.56102397692447,0.9128292984491047,0.015698061586401007,0.9294117647058824,0.9286885245901653,0.010496787621029771,0.17096424783519126,0.08812260536398467

1590,"Gheza or Géza Vida, also known as Grigore (; February 28, 1913 – May 11, 1980), was a Romanian–Hungarian sculptor, engraver, industrial worker and communist militant, one of the most renowned artists of Maramureș region. The descendant of ethnic Romanian and Slovak miners, he was born in the Hungarian segment of Austria-Hungary. Raised by his mother after his father's death in World War I, he received financial support from local benefactors, who cultivated his artistic skill, particularly as a woodcarver. A citizen of Romania after the union of 1918, he was forced to drop out of school by economic circumstances, and worked for years in various industries and businesses, while also discovering his passion for beekeeping and gardening. He was drawn into far-left politics during the Great Depression, when he came to be influenced by radical artists such as Alexandru Ziffer, Aurel Popp, Vasile Kazar and Iosif Klein, who also introduced him to avant-garde experimentation. Vida was co-opted into the Union of Communist Youth and subsequently the Communist Party, producing propaganda art for both; this activity led to his temporary arrest in 1932 and 1933. A labor organizer, he helped establish the Artists' Trade Union and its branch in Baia Mare. Having trained as a gunner in the Romanian Land Forces, Vida made repeated attempts at joining the International Brigades fighting in the Spanish Civil War. Though imprisoned and expelled upon illegally crossing the border with Czechoslovakia, he resumed the effort and finally reached Republican Spain in early 1938. He served for a few months under Nicolae Cristea and Valter Roman, before the Brigades were withdrawn from the Battle of the Ebro. Vida survived the retreat into France, surrendering to the National Gendarmerie. Vida moved between French internment camps, finally being sent to Gurs; he also continued to work as a propaganda artist, reaching an international audience.

1602,"In macroeconomics, the classical dichotomy is the idea, attributed to classical and pre-Keynesian economics, that real and nominal variables can be analyzed separately. To be precise, an economy exhibits the classical dichotomy if real variables such as output  and real interest rates can be completely analyzed without considering what is happening to their nominal counterparts, the money value of output and the interest rate. In particular, this means that real GDP and other real variables can be determined without knowing the level of the nominal money supply or the rate of inflation.  An economy exhibits the classical dichotomy if money is neutral, affecting only the price level, not real variables. As such, if the classical dichotomy holds, money only affects absolute rather than the relative prices between goods. The classical dichotomy was integral to the thinking of some pre-Keynesian economists (""money as a veil"") as a long-run proposition and is found today in new classical theories of macroeconomics. In new classical macroeconomics there is a short-run Phillips curve which can shift vertically according to the rational expectations being reviewed continuously. In the strict sense, money is not neutral in the short-run, that is, classical dichotomy does not hold, since agents tend to respond to changes in prices and in the quantity of money through changing their supply decisions. However, money should be neutral in the long run, and the classical dichotomy should be restored in the long-run, since there was no relationship between prices and real macroeconomic performance at the data level. This view has serious economic policy consequences. In the long-run, owing to the dichotomy, money is not assumed to be an effective instrument in controlling macroeconomic performance, while in the short-run there is a trade-off between prices and output (or unemployment), but, owing to rational expectations, government cannot exploit it in order to build a systematic countercyclical economic policy.",0.0,1.6012861736334405,7.188888888888889,28.272727272727273,0.3890675241157556,0.020930232558139535,-259.2602250803858,126.68199356913183,135.3324758842444,25.205476205787782,163.97679924731963,0.8596954643886645,0.024444180784575716,0.9133333333333334,0.9239057239057253,0.016450575666424643,0.17225281606138923,0.14241486068111456

Waverley Reservoir No. 1, completed in 1887, was the last of four reservoirs built to augment the Botany Swamps Scheme (1858-1886). The other three reservoirs included: 
 Crown Street Reservoir, 1859
 Paddington Reservoir, 1864 (disused and no longer owned by Sydney Water), and 
 Woollahra Reservoir, 1880. 
However Waverley Reservoir (Elevated) was not supplied solely by Botany Swamps Water, because by 1886 the Hudson Scheme had come on line, supplying water from the Upper Nepean, prior to the completion of that Scheme in 1888. Water was pumped from Woollahra Reservoir for the first six years of its service, then from Crown Street Reservoir in 1893. From 1927 onwards Waterloo Pumping Station took over supply of the reservoir. The Waverley Reservoirs were the highest of the reservoirs intended to be supplied by Botany Swamps. However it soon became apparent that additional height was required for reticulation purposes. This led to the construction of two elevated steel tanks in 1894 (now demolished). With increasing demand, these tanks were eventually superseded by the present Waverley Reservoir (Elevated) and Waverley Reservoir No. 2, both completed in 1917. Final augmentation of supply took place in 1938 with the construction of Waverley Reservoir No. 3.",0.0,1.2462686567164178,6.417582417582418,15.764705882352942,0.27238805970149255,0.025325119780971937,26.70654228855723,20.63074626865672,22.493532338308455,13.039951741293532,153.86848599216142,0.8779752500583178,0.022116138049836226,0.9000000000000001,0.9165957446808519,0.015448892343567819,0.18240175292593544,0.07272727272727272

It was one of the earliest known birds and is known for its unique features such as feathers, wings, and a beak. The first fossil of Archaeopteryx was discovered in 1861 by a farmer named Christian Koeberl near Solnhofen in Bavaria, Germany. Since then, many more fossils have been found in the area, making it one of the most important sites for dinosaur and bird fossils in the world.

1621,"Gasolin' is the first album with English lyrics by rock band Gasolin' in an attempt to win the band recognition outside their native Denmark. It is almost identical to their third Danish album, Gasolin' 3 and was released in some Western European countries in the beginning of 1974 on CBS. It failed to make impact on the charts anywhere, but didn't stop Gasolin' from issuing three more albums in English in the period from 1974 to 1978. History 
After the artistic and commercial success of Gasolin' 2, singer and principal songwriter Kim Larsen left the band. He was unhappy as he felt that too many of his new songs were rejected by the other band members. Poul Bruun, the director of CBS in Denmark, afraid to see the band disappear resolved the situation by letting Larsen record a solo album, Værsgo. He further allowed Gasolin' to record their next album in two versions, one in Danish for the home market and one with English lyrics to be released in Europe. To provide the right international sound, the record company brought Englishman Roy Thomas Baker to Copenhagen to produce the album in August 1973. Baker, at the time a hot name in the record industry following his recent success with Queen, had already worked as engineer on the band's debut album Gasolin' in 1970 and was happy to work with them again. After finishing Gasolin' 3, the band teamed up with Leonard ""Skip"" Malone, an American living in Denmark at the time, who helped the band translate the Danish lyrics into English. The lyrics were re-recorded in January 1974 and the resulting album released shortly after.",0.0,1.36,5.760233918128655,25.0,0.36363636363636365,0.02727272727272727,-52.85441335740069,55.03871841155234,59.443321299638995,16.035450180505414,164.2904878592114,0.8937978734673269,0.018995237675006937,0.9294117647058825,0.9291338582677189,0.01649058080384594,0.18333700352554966,0.1057347670250896

Full-time employment often comes with benefits that are not typically offered to part-time, temporary, or flexible workers, such as annual leave, sick leave, and health insurance. Part-time jobs are mistakenly thought by some to not be careers. However, legislation exists to stop employers from discriminating against part-time workers so this should not be a factor when making decisions on career advancement. They generally pay more than part-time jobs per hour, and this is similarly discriminatory if the pay decision is based on part-time status as a primary factor. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer (US Department of Labor). The definition by the employer can vary and is generally published in a company's Employee Handbook.

1657,"Death of Cook is the name of several paintings depicting the 1779 death of the first European visitor to the Hawaiian Islands, Captain James Cook at Kealakekua Bay.  
Most of these paintings seem to go back to an original by John Cleveley the Younger, painted in 1784, although other versions, like that of John Webber, stood model for later copies too. Such artworks were reproduced in paint and engraving over the course of modern world history.  The much more famous reproductions, like the one at the Honolulu Museum of Art (allegedly based on the Cleveley version), often depicted Cook as a peacemaker trying to stop the fighting between his sailors and the native Hawaiians that they had challenged in combat. However, in 2004, the original Cleveley painting was discovered in a private collection belonging to a family since 1851. James, Cleveley's brother was a member of Cook's crew, and the painting is said to concur with his drawings and eyewitness accounts.  The original depicted Cook involved in hand-to-hand combat with the native Hawaiians.  The discovery of the original painting has not changed the way most historians view Cook's relationship with the Hawaiians, as during his last voyage, Cook was reported by his contemporaries to have become irrationally violent.

It contains those portions of the gospels which are read during church services. ""Unlike most Gospel lectionaries, the individual readings in the Uta Codex are not arranged in calendrical order, but are instead grouped together after their respective Gospel authors."" It was commissioned around 1025 by Abbess Uta von Niedermünster, Regensburg, in Bavaria, Germany. It is a spectacular Ottonian manuscript, and is famous for its gem-encrusted gold case, with a relief of Christ in Majesty, as well as for the eight full-page miniatures. German art historian George Swarzenski described the Uta Codex as ""the wonderful gospel book, which is perhaps the most significant work of Western illumination of its time."" The manuscript consists of 119 parchment sheets, 382 × 274 mm. Four full-page frontispieces illustrate 1) the Hand of God, 2) Abbess Uta dedicating the codex to the Virgin and Child, 3) the Crucifixion, and 4) Saint Erhard, patron saint of the convent, celebrating Mass.

The largest genera are Capparis (about 150 species), Maerua (about 100 species), Boscia (37 species) and Cadaba (30 species). Taxonomy 
The Capparaceae have long been considered closely related to and have often been included in the Brassicaceae, the mustard family (APG, 1998), in part because both groups produce glucosinolate (mustard oil) compounds. Subsequent molecular studies support Capparaceae sensu stricto as paraphyletic with respect to the Brassicaceae. However Cleome and several related genera are more closely related to members of the Brassicaceae than to the other Capparaceae. These genera are now either placed in the Brassicaceae (as subfamily Clemoideae) or segregated into the Cleomaceae. Several more genera of the traditional Capparaceae are more closely related to other members of the Brassicales, and the relationships of several more remain unresolved.

 2. The spot resolutions were a way for farmers to resolve conflicts with their landowners in a non-violent manner. This was important because violence between farmers and landowners was common at that time, and the spot resolutions aimed to prevent this from happening by providing an alternative method of conflict resolution.

Many boxing champions have fought in an orthodox stance. Alternative stances
The corresponding designation for a left-handed boxer is southpaw and is generally a mirror image of the orthodox stance. A southpaw boxer guards and jabs with their right hand. Some famous boxers who use southpaw are Marvelous Marvin Hagler,   Victor Ortiz, Sultan Ibragimov, Naseem Hamed, Joe Calzaghe, Manny Pacquiao, and Lucian Bute. Francisco Palacios, Andre Ward, and Terence Crawford normally fight as orthodox, but occasionally switch to a southpaw stance to confuse their opponents. Hagler was the opposite, normally fighting southpaw but able to switch to orthodox. Some fighters who are naturally left-handed fight in the orthodox stance with the advantage of a fast, hard jab and left hook, including Oscar De La Hoya, Sonny Liston, Miguel Angel Cotto, Gerry Cooney, and Marco Antonio Barrera.

1705,"Liah Greenfeld is an Israeli-American Russian-Jewish interdisciplinary scholar engaged in the scientific explanation of human social reality on various levels, beginning with the individual mind and ending with the level of civilization. She has been called ""the most iconoclastic""  of contemporary sociologists and her approach represents the major alternative to the mainstream approaches in social science. Throughout her analyses, she emphasizes the empirical foundation of claims that she makes about human thought and action, underlining the importance of logical consistency between different sources of evidence as well as between the many interrelated hypotheses that come together to help us explain complex human phenomena. Because our thought and action are rarely limited to one, conveniently isolated sphere of human existence but rather occur within the context of more than one area of our reality at the same time (e.g. the political, the religious, the economic, the artistic, etc.) Greenfeld highlights the fact that an empirical study of humanity must necessarily be interdisciplinary. Best known for her trilogy on nationalism -- Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity (Harvard University Press, 1992), The Spirit of Capitalism: Nationalism and Economic Growth (Harvard University Press, 2001) and Mind, Modernity, Madness: The Impact of Culture on Human Experience (Harvard University Press, 2013), Greenfeld has studied and written about the entire range of modern social reality, including art, literature, science, religion, love, mental illness, ideological politics, economic competition, and so on.",0.0,1.7296137339055795,7.281045751633987,33.285714285714285,0.3706896551724138,0.026599568655643422,-191.96128755364802,97.91776824034335,102.29871244635194,23.122184120171674,131.56899810964083,0.9151638767486138,0.015600383597234585,0.9333333333333335,0.9336419753086423,0.013214353521928991,0.19818151873135484,0.12872340425531914
1706,"HaeIII is one of many restriction enzymes (endonucleases) a type of prokaryotic DNA that protects organisms from unknown, foreign DNA. It is a restriction enzyme used in molecular biology laboratories. It was the third endonuclease to be isolated from the Haemophilus aegyptius bacteria. The enzyme's recognition site—the place where it cuts DNA molecules—is the GGCC nucleotide sequence which means it cleaves DNA at the site 5′-GG/CC-3. The recognition site is usually around 4-8 bps.This enzyme's gene has been sequenced and cloned. This is done to make DNA fragments in blunt ends. HaeIII is not effective for single stranded DNA cleavage. Properties

1711,"The coral catshark (Atelomycterus marmoratus) is a species of catshark in the family Scyliorhinidae. It is common on shallow coral reefs across the Indo-West Pacific, from Pakistan to New Guinea. Reaching up to  in length, the coral catshark has an extremely slender body, a short head and tail, and two dorsal fins that are angled backwards. It can be identified by the numerous black and white spots on its back, sides, and fins, which often merge to form horizontal bars. Furthermore, adult males have distinctively long and thin claspers. Reclusive and inactive during the day, at dusk and at night, the coral catshark actively forages for small, bottom-living invertebrates and bony fishes. Its slender form allows it to access tight spaces on the reef. It is oviparous; females lay purse-shaped egg capsules two at a time on the bottom, and the young hatch after 4–6 months. This small, harmless shark adapts well to captivity and has reproduced in the aquarium; it is regarded as one of the most suitable shark species for private aquarists. The coral catshark is a minor bycatch of reef fisheries, with minimal commercial value. Increasing fishing activity and extensive habitat degradation occur within its range, leading to concern over its population and its assessment as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",0.0,1.4748858447488584,6.481751824817518,19.90909090909091,0.3744292237442922,0.024669603524229075,-152.59409090909088,89.19727272727272,93.81818181818181,21.510454545454543,109.41839912465281,0.9216917412659353,0.014543287313091558,0.9476190476190477,0.9529411764705888,0.010992263137868347,0.15424650279140362,0.1311659192825112

These cards were unique at the time as they offered the end user a considerable amount of value by combining support for multiple graphics standards (and monitors) into a single card. The VGA Wonder series added additional value with the inclusion of a bus mouse port, which normally required the installation of a dedicated Microsoft Mouse adapter.

The model is simple in that it does not consider the actual merging process between vehicles as the two branch roadways come together. The only information required to calculate the flows leaving the two branch roadways are the capacities of the two branch roadways and the exiting capacity, the demands into the system, and a value describing how the two input flows interact. This latter input term is called the split priority, or merge ratio, and is defined as the proportion of the two input flows when both are operating in congested conditions. The history of the merge model has its origins in Gordon Newell's description of the merging process, but Daganzo's cell transmission model lays out a diagram for a highway merge, and describes the application of the theory.",0.0,1.3625,6.354166666666667,32.0,0.375,0.017391304347826087,-83.17441717791408,65.35423312883435,72.31656441717791,18.405410429447855,254.5343697607072,0.8800495399904202,0.023577039549876333,0.8933333333333333,0.8986486486486485,0.02561153285790967,0.1723563237024925,0.12269938650306748

1754,"An excited utterance, in the law of evidence, is a statement made by a person in response to a startling or shocking event or condition. It is an unplanned reaction to a ""startling event"".  It is an exception to the hearsay rule.  The statement must be spontaneously made by the person (the declarant) while still under the stress of excitement from the event or condition.  The subject matter and content of the statement must ""relate to"" event or condition.  The statement could be a description or explanation (as required for present sense impression), or an opinion or inference.  Examples include: ""Look out! We're going to crash!"" or ""I think he's crazy.  He's shooting at us!""  The basis for this hearsay exception is the belief that a statement made under the stress is likely to be trustworthy and unlikely to be a premeditated falsehood.  Compared to present sense impression, excited utterance is broader in scope for permitting a longer time lapse between event and statement, and a wider range of content in the statement. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, an excited utterance is a hearsay exception, and is admissible to prove the truth of the statement itself (e.g., in the case of the first quotation above, to prove that the vehicle the declarant was riding in was, in fact, about to crash). To prove the truth of the statement means to persuade the finder of fact to believe the affirmative sense of the statement.

The net force is a measure of the amount of work that needs to be done on an object in order for it to change its velocity. For example, if a car has a speed of 60 km/h and a weight of 1500 kg, then the net force acting on the car would be: Fnet = ma - v^2/2m = (400 N)(9.8 m/s^2) - (1500 kg)(60 km/h)^2/2",1.0,1.1914893617021276,5.152777777777778,28.2,0.45925925925925926,0.02146690518783542,-30.843108108108098,54.32864864864865,62.71351351351351,17.37865135135135,236.80795847750866,0.8497212539834655,0.03059012886349304,0.8888888888888888,0.866120218579235,0.023856209150326796,0.1838802482628708,0.10590277777777779

Users of the application created virtual cards, or ""Flooks"", which were made up of a photo of a particular location and a small piece of text describing that location. These Flooks were then recorded with their geographic coordinates so that other Flook users could see where they have been posted when they are using the app. Users typically upload local secrets, places to go and things to see. The application was therefore a wiki of sorts, but was also a combination of Google Maps, StumbleUpon and review websites such as Tripadvisor or Toptable.

Players are generally not secretive about their alternate characters, unless having multiple characters is illegal, or in a role-playing environment where alternate characters might be judged by the actions of the primary character.

Frequently, people use alternate characters to ""re-live"" the game experience; high-level characters may end up running low on things to do, but deleting the character and starting completely over is often undesirable.

The resolutions requested President James K. Polk to provide Congress with the exact location (the ""spot"") upon which blood was spilled on American soil, as Polk had claimed in 1846 when asking Congress to declare war on Mexico. So persistent was Lincoln in pushing his ""spot resolutions"" that some began referring to him as ""spotty Lincoln."" Lincoln's resolutions were a direct challenge to the validity of the president's words, and representative of an ongoing political power struggle between Whigs and Democrats. Eight resolutions sought specific information. The first: ""whether the spot on which the blood of our citizens was shed, as in his messages declared, was or was not within the territory of Spain, at least after the treaty of 1819, until the Mexican revolution."" The second: ""whether that spot is or is not within the territory which was wrested from Spain by the revolutionary Government of Mexico.""

1798," model is a method for analyzing and optimizing traffic flow in intersections. It was developed by researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the University of Michigan in the late 1960s. The model is based on the idea that traffic congestion occurs when there are too many cars trying to enter a single intersection at the same time.
 2 The Newell–Daganzo merge model takes into account several factors that contribute to traffic congestion, including the number of lanes in each direction, the signal timing, and the presence of pedestrians or other hazards in the intersection. It also considers the behavior of drivers, such as their tendency to accelerate or decelerate quickly, which can lead to backups.
 3 The model is based on the idea that a smooth flow of traffic requires coordination between the signals at each intersection. This means that drivers should be able to see and respond to the signals in real-time, without having to wait for them",1.0,1.343558282208589,6.693181818181818,23.285714285714285,0.4539877300613497,0.015873015873015872,20.837357723577263,23.933658536585373,27.232520325203254,12.221076422764229,165.11708653215538,0.9043011577270214,0.018833148358046732,0.9266666666666667,0.9346938775510208,0.016614906832298135,0.16212859429605636,0.11607142857142856

Unhappy at the lack of opportunities for black people in Trinidad and Tobago, he decided to pursue a career as a professional cricketer in England, and during the 1928 tour was awarded a contract with the Lancashire League club Nelson. He played for the club with  distinction between 1929 and 1938, while continuing as a member of the West Indies Test team in tours of England and Australia.

1802,"In basketball, a technical foul (colloquially known as a ""T"" or a ""Tech"") is any infraction of the rules penalized as a foul which does not involve physical contact during the course of play between opposing players on the court, or is a foul by a non-player. The most common technical foul is for unsportsmanlike conduct. Technical fouls can be assessed against players, bench personnel, the entire team (often called a bench technical), or even the crowd. These fouls, and their penalties, are more serious than a personal foul, but not necessarily as serious as a flagrant foul (an ejectable offense in leagues below the National Basketball Association (NBA), and potentially so in the NBA). Technical fouls are handled slightly differently under international rules than under the rules used by the various competitions in the United States.  First, illegal contact between players on the court is always a personal foul under international rules, whereas in the United States, such contact is, with some exceptions, a technical foul when the game clock is not running or when the ball is dead. Second, in International Basketball Federation (FIBA) play (except for the half-court 3x3 variant, in which individual personal foul counts are not kept), players foul out after five total fouls, technical and personal combined (since 2014, one technical can be included towards the total; committing another risks immediate ejection). The latter rule is similar to that in college, high school, and middle school basketball in the United States. However, in leagues that play 48-minute games such as the NBA, and in some leagues such as the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), players are allowed six personal fouls before being disqualified, and technical fouls assessed against them do not count toward this total. However, unsportsmanlike technicals in the (W)NBA carry a fine, its severity depending on the number of technicals the player has already obtained, and players are suspended for varying amounts of time after accumulating sixteen technicals in the regular season or seven in the playoffs.",0.0,1.373134328358209,6.621212121212121,33.5,0.41194029850746267,0.024705221785513758,-269.02356083086045,134.50290801186944,141.68427299703265,26.63021632047478,138.35742630385488,0.8818636216254672,0.02030842717732767,0.9393939393939394,0.9308488612836453,0.013877043354655295,0.19386419573209165,0.11985294117647059

A professional MMA competitor from 2002 until 2013, he most notably competed in the UFC in the Middleweight division, compiling a record of 12–10 in 22 appearances for the organization. Leben first appeared in the inaugural season of The Ultimate Fighter reality series, and also fought in the now-defunct WEC. He began his UFC career with five victories in a row before suffering a knockout loss to future UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva, and was known for his toughness and powerful left hand. Leben was the inaugural WEC Middleweight Champion. Background
Leben is from Portland, Oregon and has one older brother and one younger sister. He grew up without his father around, and he did not even meet his father until he was 23 years old. Because of this, Leben's mother worked hard for many hours daily as a bartender so that she could support the family. Growing up Leben enjoyed skateboarding, dirt biking, and snowboarding. When he was in middle school, he began watching the UFC and became very interested in MMA. He began training in boxing, and then was on the wrestling team at Benson Polytechnic High School, picking up the sport rather quickly. Leben did not receive a very good education in his childhood, and did not know how to read or write even after graduating high school. Leben soon joined the United States Army, falsely being told by the recruiter that he would be allowed to wrestle for the army's team. When he found that he would not be allowed to wrestle for the army, Leben went AWOL and was discharged.",0.0,1.295774647887324,5.971098265895954,20.285714285714285,0.3345070422535211,0.024709302325581394,-55.84258710801389,56.69764808362369,61.302439024390246,15.870720209059234,107.39841471717988,0.9067223311301404,0.016564404338508063,0.9370370370370371,0.9406289308176108,0.01077847399499755,0.18033636846076456,0.1015625

He is best known for his work on the philosophy of language, logic, and metaphysics, particularly in relation to issues such as meaning, truth, and reality.
Eaglestone's early work focused on the philosophy of language, including the concept of meaning and its role in communication. In particular, he was interested in the relationship between language and thought, and how these relate to each other. He also explored the nature of logic and its applications in mathematics and computer science.
In later years, Eaglestone turned his attention to metaphysics, particularly the concept of reality and its role in understanding the world around us. His work on this topic involved exploring the relationship between mind and matter, as well as the nature of existence itself.",1.0,1.4967320261437909,7.185185185185185,21.857142857142858,0.43137254901960786,0.02481389578163772,16.29530303030304,23.739090909090915,28.32554112554113,11.924451515151516,172.44444444444443,0.8866443067059456,0.022623018168497485,0.9629629629629631,0.9406862745098037,0.017360178970917226,0.1718602931551317,0.10987261146496814

1813,"In mathematics, an ∞-topos is, roughly, an ∞-category such that its objects behave like sheaves of spaces with some choice of Grothendieck topology; in other words, it gives an intrinsic notion of sheaves without reference to an external space. The prototypical example of an ∞-topos is the ∞-category of sheaves of spaces on some topological space. But the notion is more flexible; for example, the ∞-category of étale sheaves on some scheme is not the ∞-category of sheaves on any topological space but it is still an ∞-topos. Precisely, in Lurie's Higher Topos Theory, an ∞-topos is defined as an ∞-category X such that there is a small ∞-category C and a left exact localization functor from the ∞-category of presheaves of spaces on C to X. A theorem of Lurie states that an ∞-category is an ∞-topos if and only if it satisfies an ∞-categorical version of Giraud’s axioms in ordinary topos theory. A ""topos"" is a category behaving like the category of sheaves of sets on a topological space. In analogy, Lurie's definition and characterization theorem of an ∞-topos says that an ∞-topos is an ∞-category behaving like the category of sheaves of spaces.",0.0,1.5,6.554545454545455,28.0,0.4642857142857143,0.02182952182952183,-135.86658291457283,81.64713567839196,86.43417085427137,20.41006582914573,238.24099581675338,0.8355933204863616,0.03108895193063768,0.8871794871794874,0.8905797101449278,0.023945034097318362,0.18465390247474625,0.11306532663316582
1814,"Anglo-Saxon charters are documents from the early medieval period in England which typically made a grant of land or recorded a privilege. The earliest surviving charters were drawn up in the 670s: the oldest surviving charters granted land to the Church, but from the eighth century, surviving charters were increasingly used to grant land to lay people. The term charter covers a range of written legal documentation, including diplomas, writs and wills. A diploma was a royal charter that granted rights over land or other privileges by the king, whereas a writ was an instruction (or prohibition) by the king which may have contained evidence of rights or privileges. Diplomas were usually written on parchment in Latin, but often contained sections in the vernacular, describing the bounds of estates, which often correspond closely to modern parish boundaries. The writ was authenticated by a seal and gradually replaced the diploma as evidence of land tenure during the late Anglo-Saxon and early Norman periods.

Members of the subfamily are informally and collectively known as ""tethysaurines"" and have been recovered from North America and Africa. Only two tethysaurine genera are known, Pannoniasaurus and Tethysaurus. The genera Yaguarasaurus and Russellosaurus were previously considered tethysaurines until they were grouped with Romeosaurus in the new subfamily Yaguarasaurinae. A possible member of this clade (subfamily) is a mosasaur specimen known from a maxilla fragment, found in 1960 in the Czech Republic (then Czechoslovakia), in Dolní Újezd near Litomyšl. Like the closely related yaguarasaurines, all tethysaurines were plesiopedal (meaning primitive and not as well adapted to marine life as later mosasaurs). They generally retained relatively small sizes compared to later giant mosasaurs. The tethysaurines appeared during the Turonian and went extinct in the Santonian, possibly outcompeted by more derived mosasaurs.

1853,"Observational learning is learning that occurs through observing the behavior of others. It is a form of social learning which takes various forms, based on various processes. In humans, this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement to occur, but instead, requires a social model such as a parent, sibling, friend, or teacher with surroundings. Particularly in childhood, a model is someone of authority or higher status in an environment. In animals, observational learning is often based on classical conditioning, in which an instinctive behavior is elicited by observing the behavior of another (e.g. mobbing in birds), but other processes may be involved as well. Human observational learning
Many behaviors that a learner observes, remembers, and imitates are actions that models display and display modeling, even though the model may not intentionally try to instill a particular behavior. A child may learn to swear, smack, smoke, and deem other inappropriate behavior acceptable through poor modeling. Albert Bandura claims that children continually learn desirable and undesirable behavior through observational learning. Observational learning suggests that an individual's environment, cognition, and behavior all incorporate and ultimately determine how the individual functions and models.",0.0,1.5,6.6,22.0,0.38181818181818183,0.02142857142857143,-43.78135135135133,46.94144144144144,50.52612612612613,14.974442342342341,137.17421124828533,0.9221202704709592,0.016633393160335387,0.942857142857143,0.9397163120567379,0.013845621322256836,0.16051042478672933,0.08705357142857144

This field involves understanding how individuals grow and develop in different contexts, including family, school, community, culture, society, and the larger world. Developmental psychologists study how people change over time through a process called ontogeny, which is the biological and psychological development of an organism. They also investigate the factors that influence this growth and development, such as genetics, environment, experiences, and interactions. This field aims to provide insights into human behavior and personality, and to understand how individuals develop their unique characteristics and traits.

Boyd's art criticism is lucid, well-constructed and refreshing, possessing the unusual quality of making painters legible and interesting on the page...

1894,"In computing, the Windows Driver Model  (WDM) also known at one point as the Win32 Driver Model is a framework for device drivers that was introduced with Windows 98 and Windows 2000 to replace VxD, which was used on older versions of Windows such as Windows 95 and Windows 3.1, as well as the Windows NT Driver Model. Overview
WDM drivers are layered in a stack and communicate with each other via I/O request packets (IRPs). The Microsoft Windows Driver Model unified driver models for the Windows 9x and Windows NT product lines by standardizing requirements and reducing the amount of code that needed to be written. WDM drivers will not run on operating systems earlier than Windows 98 or Windows 2000, such as Windows 95 (before the OSR2 update that sideloads the WDM model), Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 3.1. By conforming to WDM, drivers can be binary compatible and source-compatible across Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, Windows Me, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Vista (for backwards compatibility) on x86-based computers. WDM drivers are designed to be forward-compatible so that a WDM driver can run on a version of Windows newer than what the driver was initially written for, but doing that would mean that the driver cannot take advantage of any new features introduced with the new version. WDM is generally not backward-compatible, that is, a WDM driver is not guaranteed to run on any older version of Windows.  For example, Windows XP can use a driver written for Windows 2000 but will not make use of any of the new WDM features that were introduced in Windows XP. However, a driver written for Windows XP may or may not load on Windows 2000.",0.0,1.458937198067633,6.819672131147541,18.818181818181817,0.34782608695652173,0.024107142857142858,-146.31347826086954,85.09169082125604,89.5632850241546,19.090753140096616,98.50127250447734,0.9164631023501574,0.01567921156636435,0.9435897435897437,0.961111111111112,0.00989817665166943,0.15706605131841875,0.125
1895,"The family Caenolestidae contains the seven surviving species of shrew opossum: small, shrew-like marsupials that are confined to the Andes mountains of South America. The order is thought to have diverged from the ancestral marsupial line very early. They were once included in the superorder but it is now known that Ameridelphia is paraphyletic, having given rise to Australidelphia, and thus could be considered an evolutionary grade. Genetic studies indicate that they are the second most basal order of marsupials, after the didelphimorphs. As recently as 20 million years ago, at least seven genera were in South America. Today, just three genera remain. They live in inaccessible forest and grassland regions of the High Andes. Shrews were entirely absent from South America until the Great American Interchange three million years ago, and are currently present only in the northwestern part of the continent. Traditionally, it was thought that shrew opossums lost ground to these and other placental invaders that fill the same ecological niches. Evidence suggests, however, that both groups not only overlap, but do not seem to be in direct competition, and the marsupials' larger size seems to imply that they prey on shrews and rodents.

Rashiq is first mentioned in late 961, as commanding a Tarsian army sent to confront the invasion of the Byzantines under the command of Nikephoros Phokas, who were besieging Ayn Zarba. Rashiq tried to break the siege, but was defeated with heavy loss: according to Yahya of Antioch, 5,000 Tarsians fell and 4,000 were taken prisoner, while Rashiq managed to flee. As a result, Ayn Zarba surrendered (December 961/January 962). Then the governor of Tarsus, Ibn az-Zayyat, who had tried to break free from Hamdanid control, confronted the Byzantines but was also defeated. The Tarsians turned once more to Sayf al-Dawla for protection from the Byzantines, and Ibn az-Zayyat committed suicide, whereupon Sayf al-Dawla appointed Rashiq as his successor.",0.0,1.6235294117647059,7.621359223300971,21.25,0.32941176470588235,0.022022022022022022,-49.635294117647035,41.29882352941176,42.235294117647065,16.119029411764707,133.38592276524795,0.8958524857038692,0.020349284917746232,0.9515151515151516,0.9285403050108932,0.013418945242046029,0.18258587696144196,0.09943181818181818
1899,"Xerocomellus is a genus of fungi in the family Boletaceae. The genus, as it was described in 2008, contained 12 species.  However X. rubellus and X. engelii  were transferred to the new genus Hortiboletus and X. armeniacus was transferred to the new genus Rheubarbariboletus in 2015. Molecular analysis supports the distinction of Xerocomellus species from Boletus and Xerocomus, within which these species were formerly contained.  Xerocomellus in fact is only distantly related to Xerocomus and is most closely related to Tylopilus, Boletus sensu stricto, Porphyrellus, Strobilomyces, and Xanthoconium. Taxonomy
Members of the genus had been classified either in the genus Boletus or Xerocomus until Czech mycologist Josef Šutara examined a number of species and concluded that there was a defined group containing X. chrysenteron, X. armeniacus and relatives that are distinct morphologically from the group containing Xerocomus subtomentosus and related species.

The Redpsotted Hawkfish was first formally described as Pseudocirrhites pinos in 1927 by the Bermudan naturalist Louis L. Mowbray with the type locality given as Point Francis on the Isle of Pines in Cuba. In 1829 the French zoologist Georges Cuvier described a species he called Cirrhites fasciatus, giving it a type locality of Puducherry in India. This is now considered to be an error, since the fish described most likely came from the Atlantic Ocean. When Theodore Nicholas Gill described the genus Amblycirrhitus in 1861 he used Cuvier's C. fasciatus as its type species. However, Cuvier's name was preoccupied by Edward Turner Bennett's 1828 usage of the name for a related species, A. pinos is the type species of Amblycirrhitus under Cuvier's invalid name.

He is generally assumed to have been the commander of the praetorians under Gallienus. However, the sources only tell us that he was made the guardian of the Caesar Saloninus by Saloninus's father, the Emperor Gallienus. This seems likely to mean that he exercised a guiding influence over his young protégé as he represented the Imperial Dynasty in the government of the Gallic provinces. In this respect Silvanus may be compared with Ingenuus who seems to have exercised a similar function, in loco parentis, in the command of the Danubian provinces by Saloninus's elder brother, the Caesar Valeriannus, earlier in the 250s.

It formed in the southern Caribbean on October 9 and strengthened as it moved northwestward, becoming a hurricane on October 12. After crossing the western tip of Cuba, it peaked in intensity on October 16, corresponding to Category 4 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. That same day, the hurricane moved in a counterclockwise loop and hit Cuba again. It then tracked toward Florida, landing near Cape Romano. After moving through the state, it hugged the coast of the Southeastern United States on its way out to sea. Due to its unusual loop, initial reports suggested it was two separate storms that developed and hit land in rapid succession. Its track was subject to much debate at the time; eventually, it was identified as a single storm.

This theory suggests that technological progress increases productivity, which in turn leads to increased output and lower prices, resulting in more jobs being available for everyone. The full employment theorem is based on this principle, which states that if all industries are producing at maximum capacity, then the unemployment rate will remain constant or decrease over time as new technologies are introduced.

It portrays the events of the life of Saint Sebastian, including his iconic martyrdom by arrows. The film, which was aimed at a gay audience, was controversial for the homoeroticism portrayed between the soldiers and for having dialogue entirely in Latin. Plot
In the third century AD, Sebastian is a member of the Emperor Diocletian's personal guard. When he tries to intervene to stop one of the Emperor's catamites from being strangled by one of his bodyguards, Sebastian is exiled to a remote coastal garrison and reduced in rank to private.

1938,"Haloa or Alo (Ἁλῶα)  was an Attic festival, celebrated principally at Eleusis, in honour of Demeter (Δήμητρα, η Αλωαίη), protector of the fruits of the earth, of Dionysus, god of the grape and of wine, and Poseidon (Ποσειδώνας ο Φυτάλμιος), god of the seashore vegetation. In Greek, the word hálōs (ἅλως) from which Haloa derives means “threshing-floor” or “garden.” While the general consensus is that it was a festival related to threshing—the process of loosening the edible part of cereal grain after harvest—some scholars disagree and argue that it was instead a gardening festival. Haloa focuses mainly on the “first fruits” of the harvest, partly as a grateful acknowledgement for the benefits the husbandmen received, partly as prayer that the next harvest would be plentiful. The festival was also called Thalysia or Syncomesteria. The festival 
Haloa took place every year, during the month Poseideon (Ποσειδέωνας), after the first harvest was over. The festival took place around the threshing floor (αλώνια) at the same time throughout Attica. All women were expected to attend this event, but men were almost always excluded. Men had a legal and moral expectation to pay for their wives’ expenses in these festivities.
The strange timing of the harvest festival—mid-winter—is significant as well. The Greeks regarded the festival as sacred to not only Demeter but also to Dionysus. With the inclusion of Dionysus in the festival worship, the date shifted towards the winter as “he possessed himself of the festivals of Demeter, took over her threshing-floor and compelled the anomaly of a winter threshing festival.” In many ways, the festival was just as connected, if not more so, with Dionysus than with Demeter. Thus, we see the power and influence of the incoming god and of the importance of wine to Greek cult activity.

It draws its stories from Javanese history and romances and in this differs from wayang wong, which shares with wayang kulit a repertoire drawn from the Hindu epics Mahabharata and Ramayana, as well as from ludruk which uses contemporary settings and the three-walled srimulat, which specializes in vampire stories.

1942,"Off-off-Broadway theaters are smaller New York City theaters than Broadway and off-Broadway theaters, and usually have fewer than 100 seats. The off-off-Broadway movement began in 1958 as part of an anti-commercial and experimental or avant-garde movement of drama and theatre. Over time, some off-off-Broadway productions have moved away from the movement's early experimental spirit. History 
The off-off-Broadway movement began in 1958 as a ""complete rejection of commercial theatre"".  Michael Smith gives credit for the term's coinage to Jerry Tallmer in 1960. Among the first venues for what would soon be called ""off-off-Broadway"" theatre were coffeehouses in Greenwich Village, particularly the Caffe Cino at 31 Cornelia Street, operated by the eccentric Joe Cino, who early on took a liking to actors and playwrights and agreed to let them stage plays there without bothering to read the plays first, or to even find out much about the content. This DIY aesthetic also led to creative acts of object repurposing by playwrights and directors, who cobbled together sets from materials scavenged from local streets. Also integral to the rise of off-off-Broadway were Ellen Stewart at La MaMa, and Al Carmines at Judson Poets Theatre, located at Judson Memorial Church. Other theaters of note that presented many plays were Theatre Genesis, New York Theatre Ensemble, The Old Reliable, The Dove Company, The Playwrights Workshop, and Workshop of the Players Art.",0.0,1.0974025974025974,4.0,38.5,0.16233766233766234,0.08464849354375897,116.13490384615386,-0.5169871794871774,5.438461538461539,11.104138461538462,76.7429760665973,0.9380756114568319,0.012846633064970206,0.9666666666666667,0.9757575757575757,0.007736690270128508,0.2152906570782874,0.07861635220125786

1966,"Raison Oblige Theory offers an alternate explanation of exhibited behaviors widely accepted to be caused by the motive of self-verification (SVT)(William Swann, 1983). The theory addresses instances of apparent self-view confirmation strivings and details an economical description of why these behaviors occur. Focusing on the importance of the self-view and rational thought, (see self-esteem; self concept; self knowledge) Raison oblige theory (ROT) accounts for the evidence supporting SVT including the well documented seemingly mal-adaptive self verifying behaviors.  SVT states that a person is actively motivated to confirm their existing self view regardless of the objective accuracy or valence of that view. In other words, a person wants to confirm their currently held self views above and beyond wanting this information to be accurate or positive. (see self verification for details).
 ROT challenges the existence of a motive and offers a plausible explanation which can account for all instances of self-verifying behaviors.
 The fundamentals of ROT are that people are obliged by reason to accept information that is congruent with their currently held self views and reject information that is not. The theory challenges a self-verification motive, stating that people do not want to self-verify, they simply convey, through behaviour, cognitions that accurately and honestly reflect their own self views.",0.0,1.5106382978723405,6.123076923076923,18.8,0.2872340425531915,0.030364372469635626,-27.174999999999983,40.40191489361702,43.13191489361702,16.025921276595746,82.703213610586,0.9395607887580549,0.013366217860939493,0.9777777777777779,0.9863247863247866,0.008361204013377926,0.1859125023711074,0.1015625

1971,"Ra Meliga, also known as Melaga or Maleka, was a Chudasama king of Saurashtra region of western India who reigned from 1400 CE to 1416 CE (VS 1456 to VS 1472). He remove his capital from Vanthali back to Junagadh, from which place he expelled the thanadar appointed by Gujarat Sultan. Thus Gujarat Sultan Ahmad Shah I sent an army against Junagadh. He captured Vanthali and later Junagadh was besieged. Meliga left to a fort on Girnar hill which was inaccessible to the forces. So the forces left and placed two officers in Junagadh to collect tribute. Meliga died and was succeeded by his son Jayasimha II in 1416 CE. Reign
Meliga succeeded his elder brother Mandalika II in 1400 CE. His father Mokalasimha had to move the capital from Junagadh to Vanthali due to order from the Governor of Gujarat Zafar Khan on behalf of Delhi Sultan Firuz Shah Tughluq who placed a thanadar. It seems that Meliga had played no role when Zafar Khan attacked Somnath temple in 1402 CE which was under repair. Meliga expelled the thanadar from Junagadh and again made it his capital. According to the Mandalika Kavya, he had sheltered a Jhala chieftain (probably Satarsal) fleeing from Gujarat Sultan Ahmad Shah I. Mirat-i-Sikandari tells that, in 1413-14 CE, Ahmad Shah marched against Junagadh. On this occasion, Melinga fought a pitched battle with Ahmad Shah at Vanthali but was defeated and fled to Junagadh. Vanthali was taken by Ahmad Shah who then marched to Junagadh and took the lower fortress (the Uparkot but the Raja escaped by fleeing to the upper fortress of Girnar. But the Mirat-i-Sikandri adds, 'The greater part of the zamindars of Sorath became submissive and obedient and consented to service.' Ahmad Shah left two officers,  Sayad Ábûl Khair and Sayad Kásim, were left to collect the zamindar'''s tribute, salami and returned to his capital, Ahmedabad. The inscriptions (VS 1469/1413 CE) on five paliyas (memorial stones) of people died in battle at Vanthali corroborate this event.

1982,"Constant-voltage speaker systems refer to networks of loudspeakers which are connected to an audio amplifier using step-up and step-down transformers to simplify impedance calculations and to minimize power loss over the speaker cables. They are more appropriately called high-voltage audio distribution systems. The voltage is constant only in the sense that at full power, the voltage in the system does not depend on the number of speakers driven (as long the amplifier's maximum power is not exceeded). Constant-voltage speaker systems are also commonly referred to as 25-, 70-, 70.7-, or 100-volt speaker systems; distributed speaker systems; or high-impedance speaker systems.  In Canada and the US, they are most commonly referred to as 70-volt speakers. In Europe, the 100 V system is the most widespread, with amplifier and speaker products being simply labeled with 100 V. Operation
Constant-voltage speaker systems are analogous to electrical power transmission methods employed by electric utility companies to transmit electric power over long distances. Typically, an electric utility will step up the voltage of the power transmitted, which correspondingly reduces the current, hence reducing the power loss during transmission. The voltage is stepped down at the destination. Similarly, in a constant-voltage speaker system, the amplifier uses a transformer to step up the voltage of the audio signal to reduce power loss over the speaker cable, allowing more power to be transmitted over a given wire diameter. Each speaker in the system has a step-down transformer to reduce the voltage to a usable level.",0.0,1.3076923076923077,5.324675324675325,20.8,0.28846153846153844,0.04038461538461539,-23.819999999999965,42.66666666666667,48.0952380952381,15.611642857142856,88.75739644970415,0.9461841714238263,0.0115872737124954,0.9888888888888889,0.9622222222222216,0.008961911874533234,0.1846632730171445,0.11084905660377359

The name ""fougasse"" comes from the French word for a type of clay used to make the pottery, which is often red or brown in color and has a distinctive texture. 
The flame fougasse was typically made by layering different colored clays and then firing them separately in a kiln. The resulting pieces were then joined together to create more complex patterns and designs. They were used for a variety of purposes, including cooking, serving, and decorative purposes.

With an angel—a creature of fantasy unlike a religious angel—as protagonist and taking place in contemporary England, the book could be classified as contemporary fantasy, although the genre was not recognised in Wells's time.  The Wonderful Visit also has strong satirical themes, gently mocking customs and institutions of Victorian England as well as idealistic rebellion itself. Plot summary
The Wonderful Visit tells how an angel spends a little more than a week in southern England. He is at first mistaken for a bird because of his dazzling polychromatic plumage, for he is ""neither the Angel of religious feeling nor the Angel of popular belief,"" but rather ""the Angel of Italian art."" As a result, he is hunted and shot in the wing by an amateur ornithologist, the Rev. K. Hilyer, the vicar of Siddermoton, and then taken in and cared for at the vicarage. The creature comes from ""the Land of Dreams"" (also the angel's term for our world), and while ""charmingly affable,"" is ""quite ignorant of the most elementary facts of civilisation."" During his brief visit he grows increasingly dismayed by what he learns about the world in general and about life in Victorian England in particular. As he grows increasingly critical of local mores, he is eventually denounced as ""a Socialist.""",0.0,1.4906832298136645,7.38,13.416666666666666,0.3416149068322981,0.017467248908296942,3.1310351966873853,26.154906832298142,30.6592132505176,13.163584057971015,146.354970135675,0.8963070914380261,0.02045667158526203,0.9266666666666667,0.9406896551724137,0.014728126741501472,0.15291289041432518,0.12941176470588237

The grey-fronted honeyeater is a small, plain honeyeater with a yellow neck plume bordered above by black. It has a small grey patch at the forehead, that may be obscure in northern subspecies. The crown is olive yellow and the lores blackish. The upper parts are olive grey and flight feathers yellow olive. Underparts are off white with indistinct stripes. The grey-fronted honeyeater can easily be confused with the yellow-tinted honeyeater as their ranges overlap and they are of similar size.
